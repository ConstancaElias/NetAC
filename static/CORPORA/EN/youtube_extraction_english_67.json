        "postText": " Serena Williams cries sexism after receiving penalties from umpire Carlos Ramos during her Grand Slam tennis match with Japan's Naomi Osaka. Did the umpire have a double standard with how he treats men and was being sexist or was Serena Williams being a sore loser? Let us know what you think!

            "commentText": "I salute America Uncovered for providing a reasonably straightforward brief of the 2018 Open controversy.  Admittedly, Serena's heated emotions were on full display, but let's examine a small measure of her 20 year career that could shed some light, but not necessarily excuse such passion.  The 2001 <b> Indian </b>Wells incident where a then 20-year<b>  old</b> rising star endured behavior so unkind she boycotted the event for over a decade.  Or perhaps the 2004 U.S. Open tournament quarterfinal loss against J. Capriati which gathered more attention for erroneous calls against her which existing technology easily confirmed were wrong, not to mention the unfounded accusations of match fixing given voice by names within the game such as John McEnroe or fellow player Elena Dementieva.  Suffice to say, Serena is no stranger to unjust treatment by officials, competitors, or fans on random occasion.  Regarding double standards, she raised a valid point.  During the 2019 U.S. Open, Russian player D. Medvedev covertly offered a vulgar gesture to the crowd, rudely snatched a towel from a ballperson, openly insulted an umpire, and contemptuously tossed his racket toward center court.  He was fined a whopping total of $9,000.00, versus Serena's $17,000.00 in 2018.  The outburst served as no more than a temporary distraction and to state it ruined Osaka's moment is completely arbitrary.  Two unequivocal points to bear in mind: (1) Osaka raised the 2019 U.S.Open Championship trophy over her head, not her opponent.  (2) A winner's check of $3.8M bore her name and no other.  As added rationale, during post-match activities Serena supported Naomi during her moment of triumph in front of a largely pro-Serena crowd, imploring the crowd to cease booing the young champion.",

You can argue how it is enforced on men and women, but verbal abuse does not constitute a point penalty. It is a code violation. However, code violations stack from a warning, to a penalty, to a game penalty, to a default. When Andy Roddick said he had never been penalized a game, it was probably because he had only got the initial warning. So saying that men say terrible things (which they do), but don't ever get game penalties, one must realize that the context of the match determines the penalty. Also certain umpires will give you more or less leeway. Clearly, Carlos Ramos was being quite strict, which makes sense in a final that is a huge event. Serena should have realized that escalating would only cause her more trouble. I see no excuse for this behavior.",

Also,  it's indeed not as if other players haven't duked it out with umpires but she handled it in a bizarrely un-smart way. I say bizarre because she's experienced enough to know about tennis' step wise escalation of code violation. She got a code violation each for receiving coaching, then smashing the racquet and finally the last argument where she called the umpire a thief.  Third code violation earns a game penalty.  This was a bit like the Hingis Graf FO 99 final where Hingis just completely lost her mind and it was<b>  nobody</b> else's fault that she did.",

Insulting the referee after the match is a different story, but insulting him like this in the match is appalling. Umpire made the right choice and i stand behind him.",

Venus has much better composure. Serena has done this more than once. Even threatened linesmen. She's also dull of hearing it seems. The ref told her it was a coaching violation...what? The self-delusion really showed when she talked to the ref and said she would never cheat...problem fixed...no code violation right? Well, in her self-important mind it was solved. Then the racquet smash...now she's really ticked. Yes, the violation stood...no your argument didn't make any difference. What? My self-convincing speech didn't work. Point deducted. Then after ranting she says \"don't talk to me\"...he doesn't...but no she's got to win this argument...with a ref...of course you're more important than the ref...right? Wrong. So after much verbal abuse...he get's pissed off...game deduction...you can't be serious...it's not fair...it's not fair. \nThe whole thing reeks of a self-absorbed, self-important attitude. Lesson taught...lesson learned. Osaka would have won anyway.\nYes, she's been the greatest female tennis player in history...and no...you don't run the tournament or tell refs what to do.",

It just proves that you can utilise the word 'sexism' and anything else you say doesn't matter, you will have the so called 'social justice warriors' (unless there is another name for them!) clapping for you.  She goes onto say 'I'm fighting for women's equality...I guess that's opposed to 'man's equality' .  This doesn't sound like she's fighting for EQUALITY at all.  Furthermore, she says 'I swear to god i'll f*** take the ball and shove it down your f**** throat'; if a man had said that, there would be uproar and his life would have been torn apart by the media, social justice trolls etc., also, that is a direct threat of physical action, she even 'swore to god' :)  She is definitely a legend in WOMEN's tennis (because she has unbelievable power), but I'm most annoyed that because she is an awesome player, she can say what she wants and they will applaud and clap her!!! The world has gone irrational and NUTS!!",

I'm not saying she's right, only that we should stop strawmanning. Maybe we should start keeping data on this stuff in case Serena is right, or indeed to prove her wrong. Watching tapes of all of Ramos' matches sounds like a colossal waste of time though!",

            "commentText": "It's just sad that this all overshadowed Naomis win. Naomi completely thrashed Serena in the first set and in my opinion would have won the match even if Serena hadn't lost a game. \n\nI believe that Serena truly believed she didn't deserve the coaching penalty as she didn't see the hand gestures, but after that needed to let it go instead of continuing to bring it up several times after. She absolutely deserved the point penalty for breaking her racket. However, calling the umpire a thief doesn't merrit a warning and definitely doesn't merrit a game penalty. If a man can't handle getting called a thief by a <b> woman </b>he needs to grow a pair lol. if  he really was insulted by being called a thief and a liar he should have overuled and just given another point penalty rather than a game penalty as it was a final and to close to the end of the match. I completely agree with Serena that men say much ruder things with worse infliction and don't even receive warnings let alone penalties. have you seen The things Nick Kyrgios comes out with?",

Ed Gein was passionate about wearing women's skin, a russian feminist was passionately pouring very concentrated bleach that can dissolve skin onto men's crotches because of how they were sitting what I'm saying is passion isn't what makes the difference in what's right or what's wrong it's upholding the rules of the activity you're participating in, threatening and verbally abusing the person who upholds the rules is stupid that's what talking shit behind people's backs is for and you're right athletes are known for having outbursts and getting angry doesn't make it okay that's like saying since everyone I know is breaking the law I'll be okay if I do it too...no it's not okay if they do it it isn't okay if you do and if you have to justify it with 'everyone else does it' then you have a real issue with taking personal responsibility for your actions",

And I guess the one thing I feel is missing not just from Serena here, but plenty of people who have achieved greatness, is there is no shred of humility to admit that maybe there was an over reaction and that maybe jumping straight to <b> sexism </b>was a bit much, but as far as I know there has never been anything of that sort to come from this. Being able to accept and admit your mistakes is a key to continuing progress as an athlete but even more so as a human. I'm sure at some point in her career she had that and I guess I could probably cut her some slack because I have no idea what it is like to be rich and famous and even more than that to be the absolute best. So I can see how that might be a big factor in the ego and outburst, but I still really hate to see when a prominent and inspiring figure misses a great chance to set an example for the people that admire them by showing some incredibly reputable human traits like humility and redemption. Admitting mistakes has fallen out of fashion and that leads to stagnation and I think it plays a big role in society as a whole. Sorry it's a rant I have a bit of ADHD so when I get rambling it keeps coming doesn't really help I study psychology with a bit of philosophy on top...",

Therefor, she chose that moment to self-indulge in self-pity and whining (and would not stop). Don't play pro sports if you cannot handle the pressure. The judge was 100% in his penalty calls.\nOn other hand, Chris, whatever happened 30 years ago at the Boston Marathon has NO bearing on this incident at all. So, don't encourage the snow flakes, safe-spacers, pity-party-ers.",

            "commentText": "When events happen it's never one thing. It's usually multiple things coming together to flip the switch. I think it was a little of both plus Patrick not keeping his hand motions to himself.\nI speculate that Serena was feeling the pressure and she cracked. She was being beaten by Naomi playing her own game. It was close and Serena wasn't sealing the deal as handily as she would have liked. Naomi was matching her. It was too hot in the kitchen for too long lol.\nIf Serena didn't win this tournament she would have to start alllllllll oovvvveerrrr again at the Australian and time is not her friend.  She got <b> age,</b> motivation, motherhood, an off season to manage and all these new fearless, strong, big ball hitting whippersnappers who are not intimidated and have far less to lose and let's not forget the regular cast of spoilers too.\nShe needs two more to pass Margaret. She was feeling it and maybe all of the above mentioned and all it took was that call by the umpire to light the whole thing on fire \ud83d\udd25. \nBtw I don't think she was cheating with her coach. Don't know why he said what he said. It's odd and irresponsible right!?\nSleeping with one eye open here in case she's coming for me. Lol just kidding.\n\nHonestly, when you think of the immensity of the pressure she's under and how she has to play it out in front of the whole world..the money, the people, the organizations, the family, the sponsors, the coaches, the media, the popularity of the game, equal rights, women's rights, representin', the legacy, setting a record that we will probably not see broken in our lifetime or the one after ours plus all the other things we don't know about and probably never will etc etc etc! you/we will never experience at that level. We can only imagine what it's like. We can't judge what happened as if we know everything.  In the long run everything will be ok.",

What matters is that in the game that Serena played, Serena broke the rules. There's reason to believe she may have used coaching. She broke the tennis racket. She verbally insulted the umpire. She should be given consequences accordingly, regardless of how other umpires interact with other players in separate games.",

One thing I'd like to point out is when Williams says \"I've seen men say a lot worse and not be penalised\", those men probably didn't explode and smash a racket after getting a warning for suspected cheating! I get that she feels like it's an attack on her character, but Jesus Christ you already lost a point by smashing a racket, how thick headed do you have to be to then verbally attack the umpire for a prolonged period of time?! For everyone who says \"The point loss was uncalled for!\" lemme ask you this, did she or did she not, smash her racket after being WARNED, that she was SUSPECTED, of cheating? Yes? Well there you go.",

You owe me an apology ( a second accusation). Ramos did<b>  nothing</b>. 3. You owe me an apology. You'll never ever ever be on another court of mine as long as you live. (A threat to Ramos's career & livelihood and a claim that she has more power with officials in the game, than he does.) Ramos di<b> d nothin</b>g. 4. You are a liar. (A direct libel towards Ramos and in clear breach of the player's code). Ramos d<b> id nothi</b>ng.  5. You stole a point from me. (A direct accusation of the umpire's dishonesty.) Ramos hesitated. 6. You're a thief too. (A direct libel towards Ramos). He STILL hesitated. And then awarded the penalty.\nHow much abuse is an umpire supposed to take without being speciously accused<b>  of sex</b>ism? \nRamos showed amazing restraint probably BECAUSE Serena <b> is a w</b>oman. If a male player had behaved like this, Ramos surely would have called a code violation long before.\n\n\nAnother telling moment is when she breaks her racquet. She flinches in case the racquet bounces back and hits her. This shows (a) she is not out of control, she is aware of the consequences of what she is doing, even in the minutia, and (b) she has done this many times before and instinctively knows what happens. This is a clear giveaway of her intentions and her state of mind. It appears every bit as if she is deliberately stalling, trying to interrupt her opponent's concentration and to intimidate the umpire or at least challenge the umpire's authority by \"double-daring\" him to award a code violation.\n\n\nShe's losing. She knows it. Like all great champions she has a healthy dislike of losing. But that's no excuse for behaving in an appalling fashion towards the official and to rob her opponent of her moment in the sun. \n\n\nThe New York crowd should also hang their collective heads in shame. Serena was not behaving like a local hero that day.",

I'm sure other women have done the same and gotten away with it too.  But that's an irrelevant point.  The point is that She is the biggest name in female tennis and should be held to a higher standard than other players who haven't achieved half what she has achieved; she is supposed to set the example for what women's tennis is supposed to look like.  And, for the record, I've never seen Roger Federer or Nadal (the male equivalents to her status in Tennis) act this way before.  \n\nShe deserved the penalty and I think women everywhere should look to a different athlete as their role model because Serena just showed that she thinks she's entitled to special treatment because of her fame.  Poor sportsmanship!",

Still his team got penalised.....in 1997 he closed on the <b> last </b>race with this rival Jack Villeneuve..... He was disqualified from the championship....... In Monaco he did similar thing in qualifying...... He was sent  to the back of the grid..... Same goes for Valentino Rossi..... In 2015 he crashed into Marc Marquez which made the other guy go on the ground....... What Happened ?? Rossi was sent to the back of the grid in the<b>  next</b> race knowing that it was the<b>  fina</b>l race and if he was sent to the back there was no chance of him winning his tenth title but still he was penalized.\nSo keeping all this, the bigger personality you are the harder is and should be the punishment......

            "commentText": "For someone who has won the Grandslam 23 times, Serena should be ashamed of herself. The fact that her coach admitted to giving her signals, she should have publicly apologized for losing her temper.  She took away something from Naomi that you could never give back. I'm sure Serena remembers her 1st Grandslam win and would have been very offended if her opponent was complaining that the umpire had something against her.  It's always going to look like Serena lost because of Ramos, not because Naomi was good enough.  She won the first set 6-2 and was always leading in the 2nd.  Serena jumped on the opportunity to put a question mark on whether or not it was a fair match and she did it quite well.  I hope she's proud of herself.",

For them to play at this level , the pressure is high. I'm a fan of tennis and love to see great players play . This sport should sometimes let the players show some emotions because they are not robots.  JMO if you hate a player , you will never see anything positive in them. If you pay attention to Naomi Osaka , she apologizes to ever player that she beats.  After all this Naomi said she still respects and loves Serena Williams , I think everyone should let this go. When Serena per Naomi own words told her she was proud of her , Naomi said it meant a lot to her . So Naomi and Serena do not hate each other . This is not the first nor last time a player will show emotions. I'm not  looking for them to be machines . Most of them are proven winners and should be respected for their hard work.",

Williams and her sister both claimed they could even hammer any male Tennis player ranked 250 and above. They both got defeated by a male Tennis player ranked below 250. He challenged them both and massacred them in two one on one matches. The Williams sisters then changed their attitude and claimed they could beat any man ranked in the 500's. Seriously the problem isn't the umpire. It is the player. In this instance.",

Whether it's a tear (oh, she won't be able to handle the responsibility) or a shout (she's out of control and a poor loser).  Think back for a moment about how Hillary Clinton over modulated her emotions, almost appearing to be too stoic and impersonal at times (was she trying too hard?) and compare her demeanor to Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential campaign...it just shows you that a<b>  woman</b> will always be judged more severely than a man when it comes to portraying herself as powerful and in control.",

Every player, after all, still has to play the match  she has to execute on every point, and she should never be held responsible for the actions of a coach. Coaching happens all the time, at all levels of tennis. So why not just allow it?, and Enjoy the Tennis Match.",

Allowing coaching during matches would give the wealthier players a significant advantage on the court. Also, in any sport, the team gets penalized if the coach does something illegal. In American football, if the coach accidentally steps onto the field during a play, the team gets penalized for it.\n\nAlso, the argument that everyone does it isn't valid either as it's still against the rules. If you get pulled over for speeding, and your defense is \"everyone else does it\", you're not getting out of that ticket. Sometimes you get unlucky, and you get caught, and that's what happened to Serena. She, as a professional, shouldn't have lost her head about it.",

You dont get out of a punishment by pointing to someone else who got away with it and wanting to also get away with it. Thats how little kids argue. 'My brother does that all the time and you never punish him'. She knows she made a huge mistake. She should have kept her mouth shut during the match and brought up her complaints afterwards. And she knows it. But she is still trying to win the arguement the wrong way. The more she blabbers on, the more she is losing respect. She should be asked the right questions like what she thinks of her behavior and if it merited punishment and not let her compare it to other players who got away with anything. If other similar situations had different outcomes is besides the point of whether or not she deserved what she got, according to the rules, THE RULES! And serena is great at coming back from being behind in a match. She could have won, had she just controlled herself. Then she would have looked like a champion instead of a big baby. Sorry to say that because she is such a great player. I hope her behavior is not provoked by drugs. I dont mean recreational drugs. I mean performance enhancing ones. She should have bern tested after that long long outburst. I understand outburstts but not like that where she knew she should have stopped long before, but couldnt, maybe due to having consumed something. The communucation with her coach was obvious and blatant. Take the pount penalty and move on. Dont act like a baby and carry the behavior into interviews after the thing is long over.",

That's the question, I saw Serena play many matches before and she was all fine, not as emotional or careless like this except we came across to same scenario before against Kim Clijsters which was a new mother back then and the<b>  woman</b> casually won US Open.Gotta love her. :D\n\nThere is no excuse for what Serena did or what she said about al<b> l sexis</b><b> m, raci</b>sm, etc. She just ruined Naomi's first grand slam celebration which meant a lot to her and her country as well.\n\nNever cared much about Serena before, her gameplay doesn't give me any joy but never had any type of emotion against her till now since I didn't care about her games but now I just don't like her at all.Hope never gets to any other finals so I won't have to watch her, hope no one has to watch her.",

Too...ramos has been verbally abused by kyrios...he was sending f-bombs at Ramos and he did <b> nothing.</b> Same with Djokovic....ramos did<b>  nothing</b>... that is why she complained. Also..i don't how many of you actually follow the sport or just want to comment...but tennis more than any other sport is really about the players. Yes they are bigger than the game that is why the stars get appearance fees to play at tournaments. Also...if a tournament is sponsored by a sports management company ..players who are not managed by that company will not get invited.  Too...if Serena is in a final the ratings for the final are very high versus her not being in a final. Which means more money in advertising dollars.... however...her point is that he ignored the men but instantly penalized her... that is why she complained and no he probably won't work another match of hers. Too..\nOnly one Serena...chair umpires are everywhere<b> . Nothin</b>g special about him. The don t pay to see chair umpires...",

She got a game penalty because she had 2 previous point penalties in which she is definitely guilty of breaking her racket and the coaching is debatable as maybe she didn't see but the coach was definitely making efforts to have her see. Also to make the claim you are fighting for womens rights when the women you fought just had a historic win for her country and you made her APOLOGIZE for that is fucking disgusting. You are only for womens rights when you are the one in the spotlight.",

If the umpire heard bad things during a game and did not penalize anyone, yes, he acted erroneously and did not apply the rule as it should, but in this case, the umpire did what he learned.\n\nWanting to use these conditions (that other players have said worse and have never been penalized) as evidence that she was right, is wrong. Serena could have accepted the first penalty without performing other outrages - but no - she went further and provoked the others. And she wanted it not to be penalized?\n\nFinally, she should have been angry with her coach - which by the way - deconstructed a basic foundation of their relationship. In a nutshell, it was her coach who caused all the stress.",

If it would've been her first or second violation, he wouldn't have docked a whole game. Serena is right: men have indeed called umpires far worse many times and haven't been docked a whole game - but this was simply because they hadn't accumulated three code violations,  after they had insulted the umpire. They knew when to shut up. Serena didn't. That's all. No <b> sexism </b>at all triggered this unfortunate escalation. When Andy Roddick said on Twitter that he has called umpires far worse without getting a game penalty, he hadn't thoroughly analyzed Serena's specific situation. Andy simply hadn't accumulated three code violations after  he had insulted an umpire with foul language.\n The umpire acted totally within the existing rules in Serena's case. It's deplorable that the WTA and the USTA failed to acknowledge this clearly.",

One umpire is not the entire association of umpire and a couple of male players is not all of the male players. I thought an umpire was a judge and discretion and case by case judgement are applicable to the day and situation. In a court room a judge can hold you in contempt (with probable cause) if you give them a reason OR guess what...they DON'T have to. \n\nThe idea is why tempt it. Why bash and shit on the individual who can JUDGE rather or not you're being out of line in that very moment and invoke a penalty against you. \n\nAnd even then --- PERSONALLY ---- I'd rather be called a chicken shit or a wanker or a fucking idiot than to be called a sexist. The former statements are made out of just anger. The latter statement isn't just made out of anger. Its an assault on my character.<b>  Nothing</b> is more insulting than having your very nature attacked --- especially when you're just doing your job. \n\nThe only way you could systematically prove this MAY have been sexist is to gather up all of code violations based on abusive or derogatory nature and tally how much of it is female player to male umpire and male player to male umpire.

I think she was finding an excuse for having her tantrum and reached for what was available, so the chair umpire was a man so why not say that <b> colored </b>his officiating for her excuse. Her 2009 US Open final blowup had a<b>  woman</b> chair but still Serena went as far as to threaten the lines person with shoving a fucking tennis ball down her fucking throat for calling foot fault on her, so you see we have Serena getting out of hand because things were not going her way. The match was over when the female chair umpire gave a point deduction on match point, wel<b> l rac</b>e came into play because the chair umpire was white and the lines person was Asian. You see where I'm going with this, unless there's some glaring proof where do you stop blami<b> ng ra</b>ce, religion<b>  or </b>sex for the outcome of umpiring? And if a male player was to say the same thing Serena said to a diminutive female lines person about shoving a ball down her throat, he would have effectively ended his career and never heard the end of criticism, so yes I can<b>  see se</b>xism in that instance because Serena has gotten a free pass for that one.",

She is an insult to everything she claims to stand for and has set so many things backwards because of her petulance and infantile hissy fits.\nI have been complaining quite a lot recently about tennis stars acting like they owned the world, instead of them owing the world everything. A prime example was Djokovic, who I suspect has been put firmly in his place by all around him because he is now acting more like an adult and not a spoilt 6 year <b> old.</b>\nDid you see the match when a kid couldn't understand when he was called out and penalised for hitting a ball into a  chair umpire's eye and injuring him \"because everyone does it\". And that is what Williams and her ilk are responsible for. She should be ashamed of herself and apologise to the world.\nfyi I have read and watched reactions and reports from around the world and the telling thing is that the only country where Williams gets support is the USA, which is also an indictment of the sorry state the USA has sunk into.\nI remember JFK with his 'My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\nTrump, Williams et al : \"My fellow Americans, ask not what you can do for your country, ask how much your country can subsidise and support you, whilst you avoid doing anything remotely meaningful in life.",

However, over the recent years she has been revealing more and more of her feminist-sexist attitude. Wish Bobby Riggs or someone else had beaten her then. Anyway she is an embarrassment to having the USTA Tennis Center with her name on it. Especially compared with Rod Laver in Melbourne is a true representative of tennis and would not attempt to use his credentials to further political agenda or false social agenda; Though Martina Navratilova's social media statements support Carlos Ramos and state the conduct and behavior of Serena was incorrect, still she stated about inequality of judgments across tennis, which is not correct though there are some variances, but so do every sport-game. It is normal, because of humans vary. Am actually more disappointed with Chris Evert, especially she was commenting on the match, and during the broadcast states the issues of Serena's conduct and behavior. Then on social media states that Carlos Ramos went overboard. That is clearly two-faced. Secondly, would expect she would actually know the Regulations, but her social media statements show her ignorance; Martina's statements confirm her knowledge of the Regulations. Billy Jean King seems to ignore the Regulations and states her opinions based upon her pre-supposed, premise of Feminist-SJW, PC type mindset. And Patrick McEnroe, former head of USTA is another embarrassment, also showing his ignorance of the Regulations. So is Katrina Adams a similar embarrassment. Seem time for a replacement to get balance in their. Katrina at the award ceremony clearly showed bias toward Serena. It was disgusting, appalling, disgraceful. See how different she was last year with Sloane Stephens. Indications she is a racist-SJW type, though not absolutely clear. Nonetheless, under Katrina's direction there has been degradation and there needs to be a turn-around. They could have supported Naomi Osaka. They also have not much going in the Men's area so far either. There are so many foreigners who specifically move to the USA for tennis development and training, and maintain their country affiliations. That is fine, just shows, there is among the best training, development available but not very many USA citizens. The women do have many rising often, not many stars from the bunches yet. Some more promising currently, we will see. Of course, which other sport other than professional tennis can a <b> woman </b>excel and achieve large amounts of money. Do not have to even be #1 nor GS winner to get high levels, though the bigger amounts come with either or both. For men, there are numerous other sport-games for athletes to choose. This is world-wide, though elsewhere limited more to football/soccer and tennis.",

So big up to your father Mr Williams, and I do hope that everything is ok \ud83d\udc4c with him. And I cannot understand why have Serena take on a white person mentality Serena you<b>  are b</b>lack and white people will always see y<b> ou as </b>black, even though you are married to a white man it make no difference what so ever, now you adopt the white people dirty nasty mentality of being very arrogant and you have move far away from your own culture and roots to embrace and adopt another person culture before and one say anything I am a very realistic person, yes I know that we have choices but it is what we do with the choices that we are given that is what define a person of been who they are. It is said that we are living in a white man world, but I begged to differ we are living in Jehovah god world \ud83c\udf0d.\nso did not the white man came and saw that the earth was here long before he came and imposed his will with physical brute force and the white man did not pay any attention to what Jehovah our righteous majestic father had said in the bible he said thou shall  not kill the white man shed lot of innocent \ud83d\ude07 blood on this earth to get where they are now.",

Serena not a <b> woman </b>anyways, she a freaken man!!! Even her shitty eyebrows and facial bone structure shows us that. Men have big eyebrow ridges and sloping skulls. Which as you can see Serena has along with a male body. You can see the difference in the skull structure as the two players stand side by side. Hell her forehead slopes back just like the guy's narrating in this video and her eyebrows are as thick as his too. Only a man can put so much force into the way she threw her racket down and bent it up like that. The older she gets the more manly she becomes. The harmone she has been taking only works best when young. You can't fight nature. Wake up people Serena and her sister are men!!!",

However, that doesn't defend the fact of how she threw her tennis racket and started yelling at the umpire during the match. Tbh, I don't really care about her misconducts, as this happens in sports often. I'm upset of the fact that her opponent, during probably her most anticipated moment in her life, has her victory shunned instead of celebrated. She cried even though she was the victor- and booed by fans during the ceremony.",

Sexist!  12% of the US is responsible for 50% of all murder and violent crime(one city alone they kill over 1k people a year. To make clear just how bad that is, every mass shooter in the history of our country has killed about that many people.  12% in once city in one year match every mass shooter EVER. Zimbabwe started killing pasty farmers in 2000. Well, they were tortured to death and their wives and children were raped to death.  Now the people of Zimbabwe are starving and want the people they tortured and killed back. The same thing has just started in South Africa, Female genital mutilation, gang rape of babies, genocide, fistula epidemic, albino children are hunted killed and eaten for their magical powers. There is no such thing as an 12% first world country. It does not exist. What is worse my words stating facts or the things I just typed.",

Even now some people believe this nonsense, unfathomable! Imagine if she played against a white man, the umpire would have been fired by now. This shows the hypocrisy of people who see world through their own lenses and isolate themselves from reality. Want to tell me Fabio Fognini was discriminated against because he was secretl<b> y a bl</b>ack female? Mouratoglou himself, Serena's coach admitted he was coaching her. She is a disgrace, Serena should be punished and Naomi compensated from being robbed of her victory.",

Male players have done worst, cursed out chair umpires and they were not fined a game point, or a set point. That's extreme. It's a grand slam. Why wasn't the other coach not caught coaching. I saw him giving signals. No said anything. Male player like McEnroe not got a point game or set taken away. MAKE THE RULES THE SAME FOR MEM AND WOMEN.

She watched Serena from the upper part of the stands as a child, wanting to play on that court and with Serena, whom she looked up to. This was as she dreamed, as she said in the post-interview of SF what gave her strength to battle each break point in her match with Madison. She imagined playing Serena, and it would be the best to honor Serena by playing her best. As she said, to Serena, thank You for playing, and to the crowd for watching. She was truly emotional about it all. Everything is very meaningful to her. Am fairly certain there is more also, about her parents, Mother and Father, how they 'sacrificed' everything for she and her sister. Did You see the long, warm embrace with her Mother? Though their faces were only with each other, could sense, feel emotions flowing and aroused them in me too.\nShe wasn't apologizing for what many may have thought and she wasn't sad. This is Naomi's way. She has an interesting combination of Introvert and enjoying playing in front of a huge crowd. Am still working to comprehend this combination. Part of her apology seems to be for those who were cheering for Serena, expecting Serena to win her 24 GS, and feeling for their disappointment, not for winning. Again, Naomi showed honor to Serena, her parents, coach, team by playing her best and performing as she did which she feel good about.\nHope this Helps\nAll The Best!",

She feels entitled to it because she is Serena Williams. Just look at the ads before and during the entirety of the U.S.Open...it went something like this...Don't call it a comeback because I've been here before and no matter how much she wanted it and how much the sponsors thought that she was a shoe-in to win, she lost plain and simple. How does one make a big fuss hoping to change the outcome of the match and go so far as to slander and ridicule a very good chair umpire.The fine should have been much,much bigger.Let's see how much she is booed at the Australian Open in January.People pay huge money for these seats and don't need such childish outbursts. No<b>  sexism</b> here,she was just plain wrong here.",

When you mentioned the other male players that have \"clashed\" with Carlos Ramos, you said they didn't get penalised, but they did. If you read the articles you showed us, they clearly state \"The serb got a time warning violation\" ; \"I say towel out loud and I get a code?\" ; \" [...] before deciding to dock Nadal a first serve\".\n\nThe point here is that Serena accumulated code violations for multiple infractions. And just like in soccer,  where you can get sent off for a not so severe foul by accumulating <b> yel<b> low<b>  </b</b</b>>>cards after a series of fouls, in tennis you can get bigger consequences like game penalties after accumulating code violations (Serena lost a game after her third code violation). A fourth code violation would see her lose the match by default, just like it happened to John McEnroe at the Australian Open. So it's not a matter <b> of sexi</b>sm,<b>  or rac</b>ism, or anything. It's a matter of Carlos being very strict with the rules and enforcing them regardless of the play<b> er's </b><b> race</b>, sex, or even status. He's not afraid of penalizing the biggest players like Serena, Rafa or Novak. Great umpire",

The figures obtained by the Times show that men received 649 fines for breaking racquets to 99 for women in tens of thousands of matches in the four Grand Slams over the last two decades.\n\nMen were fined 344 times compared to 140 for \"audible obscenity\" and 287 to 67 for unsportsmanlike conduct.",

A large group of people have taken Serena's side. \n\nFeminism is a cancer but it is just a part of the cancer we have in the west we call \"social justice\". It will lead to everything it is \"fighting against\". People will gain a group mentality and we will go backwards as a society.",

She seemed very defensive when called out for it and instantly said that she was not a cheater. Yet according to her coach, he admitted to doing it, which means she is a cheater. Then she brings her kid into it, playing that card was low. Her kid has <b> nothing </b>to do with the match, there is no reason to bring it up. Then the<b>  sexism</b> accusation and saying that he'll never ref her court again? Now she is just being mean because she doesn't have any basis for that claim, (do you think she knows his history of calls enough to make that claim? Personally I do not.) and to threaten the man's job because of her entitlement that the sport has given her? I don't follow tennis much and this turned me off from following women's tennis, at least while Serena is still playing. The possibility of the 'greatest women's player of all time' being a cheater and sore loser is not a great look.",

Now, the umpire said that Serena was taking coaching from her coach. This is could be or could not be right because in order to verify this claim we need to watch the video when Serena was looking at her coach for those signals.\n\nSo for time being this is either an accusation or misreading on the umpire's part. Serena might have looked at her coach or not. No one can say for sure unless we have proof. So she took offence to this accusation from the umpire. And defended herself by saying she never cheated in her life because taking coaching during the game is illegal. \n\nSo ultimately, for the lack of evidence, this is all the fault of her coach. He should not have been doing that. But fault also lies with Serena albeit to a lesser degree that she misbehaved with the umpire.",

It's a high-pressure environment and it is no wonder that players lose their cool on occasion. \n\nSerena would be better off owning it and apologising profusely to Osaka for not being the idol the young<b>  woman</b> had dreamed of playing. It was uncomfortable to watch and a very disappointing display of a star losing her cool and making matters much worse than they should have been. \n\nIt seems to me rules were clearly broken and penalties were correctly applied but it needs to be the same across the board. Being strict with everyone, men and women alike would hopefully improve court conduct all round but at the end of the day, we are all just human beings and when emotions become involved in such a high-pressure situation, it must be so very hard to keep your cool 100% of the time. Rather them than me. :)",

            "commentText": "The rule which doesn't allow coaches to interact with players during the match seems a little archaic to me.  What's the point there? Don't most all other pro sports allow these things? That peculiarity notwithstanding, Ms. Williams appeared to be sluggish early on (with Osaka winning the the first set fairly easily) and was growing noticeably more emotional as the second set proceeded.  Whether she was aware her coach was giving her hand signals doesn't really mater. He was seen doing so by the Ump (and later her coach unapologetically admitted it), and as such it was Ramos' job and duty to put the kabash on it.  I didn't hear Mr. Carlos accuse Ms. Williams of cheating per se. The warning looked to be more of a \"now-now, let's not openly flaunt the rules\" kind of thing.  She soon thereafter clearly violated the racket abuse rule and so the Ump had no choice but to penalize her a point.  It looked like Ms. Williams could sense the match slipping away from her after that and let her emotions get the better of her. With some time and reflection I suspect she'll realize she didn't handle herself well and will be embarrassed at how she took her frustration and anxiety out on the Ump. You don't win 23 major titles without having some passion roiling around inside of you, and anyone who has played competitive sports probably has a memory or two of themselves they're not all that proud when the battle was raging and defeat looked imminent. I know I do \u2026 Here's wishing Ms. Williams the strength of character to admit her frailties and right her wrongs. With respect to her stated desire to support equal rights for womenkind \u2026 we're all with you sister, we're all with you ...",

There are plenty of other players in tennis, she is just a female <b> colored </b>player is what you are saying. She has no control over her emotions and acted like an impulsive animal. And like every other person that acts this way, she then victimizes herself when appropriate actions are taken against her. Every umpire csn make a call they see fit so if one takes less shit than another, it's probably not wise to start screeching at him. She is just another failed sports career in the making brought down by her own victimization and inability to act like a decent human being.",

Second, assuming for the sake of argument that this extremely masculine-looking \"<b> woman\"</b> was not born a male, the fact remains she deserved to be penalized for the ridiculous tantrum \"she\" thew, because it was not a brief, one-time, heat-of-the-moment outburst, but rather something she kept on doing.

Sports players, musicians, actors, hell even youtubers do it now. All of these careers are inflated with money and make way more than they ever deserve for what they do. Yes they can all be stressful jobs but do they make the world go round? No. If each of those careers died off the world would keep going. They get paid shit tons to do what is known as a hobby. So it kind of dims down these \"amazing things they do\" when they can literally wipe their ass with money because \"I hit ball good\" or \"I catch ball good\". Not saying what they do isn't amazing at times. It's just a cash cow product and they really serve no importance. So yeah it's kinda expected of them to do these things since the normal people with normal jobs can't throw that much money around. It is funny you throw <b> race </b>into it though as slowly but surely all through the \"white male privilege\" you all like to screech about, being a white male is becoming shitier to be as literally anything you don't agree with or do can be labeled as<b>  sexism</b<b> >/racis</b>m/any kind of ism the victimized can come up with. Their opinions are thought of as null and void on any topics even if it is to further the ending of such issues. And while there are many forms <b> of raci</b>sm <b> and sex</b>ism, women<b>  and col</b>ored people are becoming just as if not more guilty of it now. They just like to create their own rule called the \"I'm not white or male so i can't be it\" rule. Hate to break it to you but through all this commotion <b> about r</b>aci<b> sm and </b>sexism, there's been a l<b> ot more</b> ra<b> cism an</b>d sexism coming from the fe<b> males an</b>d colored lately which is sad since they should be helping to end it.",

Though it was surprising to witness the lack of Tennis knowledge or etiquette portrayed by this audience, upon further review we should have expected it. Let's face it, major sporting events have become the modern Coliseums of the world. The vast majority of those in attendance are the very wealthy and beautiful people who can afford to attend or are invited/gifted tickets in many instances. As a result you won't find a knowledgeable audience in attendance who actually understand the intricacies of the game but rather a group of socialites only interested in being seen with the who's who of society. Serena unfortunately has perpetuated this image through years of cultivating relationships within the entertainment industry. Unfortunately that is what happens when money becomes the driving force behind anything.",

However, it has been tainted by her outbursts not just once but many times. In life, we sometimes forget that we don't control our destiny. When Serena walked down the court to start her game at the US Open Championship, she had no inkling that an ugly incident would occur. Maybe she can blame her coach for doing what he did. Had he not done that, this snafu would not have happened. If only Serena had focus on the spiritual side of her life, she will be able to practice patience, humility, forgiveness etc. but hey...I am not in a position to judge her. I have never liked Serena for different reasons. I have other favorites & they are dignified players who play with dignity & grace on the courts. However, I have watched Serena play many times & am in awe of how powerful she is. She meticulously deals with the different facets of her game. Are we looking at the future no. 1 player in Naomi Osaka? Perhaps, time will tell. Congratulations Naomi, we love you & wish you the very best in your blossoming career in tennis. Way to go!!!",

Male tennis players have had bigger infractions and have remained penalty free. Ramos has been called derogatory names by males during matches. Male players have threatened to not allow him to officiate  their matches in the future. Silence from Ramos. In closing I'll present two names for your review: Andre Agassi & John McEnroe. Famous for their tempers along with being brilliant athletes. Many a broken racquet and foul language between them.  I guess I'd compare it to two drivers who are drunk behind the wheel. One gets a DUI the other did not. The one that did was guilty, it's the law and was applied properly by the officer. So was the other driver, but he got away with it. The same officer was not consistent in his application if the law.  So the conversation is not a matter of rules,or even her behavior. Since it was clearly broken. It's more of a matter of whether the application of rules are consistent across time. That's the narrative, not whether she was wrong or a poor sport. There's bigger offenders. The penalty should stick because bad application in previous cases doesn't negate guilt. However, some sort of compromise should be worked out. There should be discussions on how to maintain consistency. There should also be penalties for non consistent behavior.",

Frequently male players say and do much worse things and their behaviour is ignored and sometimes even praised. Match commentators often remark that it was good to get the frustration out so they can play more freely. In this U S Open, an umpire engaged in a long, supportive conversation with a stressed male player who then got it together and went on to win the match.  Carlos could have given a warning to Serena's coach about coaching and/or warned Serena if she persisted in her accusations, she would forfeit a game.  It would have contributed to a better final, whatever the outcome",

            "commentText": "For anyone that thinks that Serena (and hundreds of other athletes from ALL pro sports) isn't a \"cheat\", read on... Most top athletes are \"cheats\", it's just that they manage to do it \"within the rules\". The biggest culprits in tennis would seem to be Serena, Venus and Nadal, though it happens in ALL professional sports. There is a system in pro sport known as TUE (Therapeutic Use Exemption), which allows pro sportsmen/women to have otherwise illegal performance enhancing drugs prescribed to them. What they do is tell their personal doctor that they are ill, the doctor then fills out a TUE form stating the illness and the drugs required to treat it and hands the form to the sporting governing body. The sporting governing body then ok's the use of the drug requested for the time period requested. This is a system that has been abused by most top sports people in almost every pro and Olympic sport for many years. The higher profile athlete you are (and all high profile athletes have their own personal <b> doctors </b>making it even easier because the doctor will back up their claim of being ill) the more likely the governing body will say yes to the use of otherwise illegal performance enhancing drugs. This system has remained secret to the public until a couple of years ago when the WADA database was hacked and hundreds if not thousands of previously confidential TUEs were downloaded and made available for all to see. Journalists got hold of the forms and both Serena and Nadal were interviewed about their prolific and in Serena's case almost constant use of illegal performance enhancing drugs and all both could say was \"I have done<b>  nothing</b> wrong, everything I've done is within the rules\". In Serena's case I personally looked through all her TUEs and cross referenced the drugs she took and the times that she took them and I was astonished to find that they almost always coincided with the major slams. In fact on quite a few occasions she was taking hard-core performance enhancing drugs (officially for a particular ailment) from between 6 and 2 weeks before some of the grand slams dating back to 2009 and when I researched the particular drugs she was using, they didn't have an effect on the athlete until 2 weeks AFTER adminstering ended. In other words, she was reaping the performance enhancing benefits just as the tournament started and throughout it's 2 week duration. This I found to be a recurring feature in her TUE strategy way above any other athlete from any other sport. I'm sorry to burst your bubble (I was devastated and very upset for days when I realised the truth behind ALL pro sport) but these are the hard facts. Let's not forget that we live in a capitalist society where profit comes above all else and the bottom line is that top athletes bring a HUGE amount of money into their given sport and thus the governing bodies constantly allow these TUEs to be granted, especially to the biggest names because they bring in the most money - also the use of drugs (particularly in athletics) means that at various times world records will be broken, which HAS to happen because that generates greater public interest which in turn generates even more revenue. If world records were never broken interest would eventually wane, meaning less profit. As we saw in the Lance Armstrong case, a governing body will protect a top athlete because they bring so much attention (money) into their sport. In Armstrong's case he was protected for years by the UCI until the evidence became so overwhelming that the UCI eventually had to distance themselves from him to protect themselves. As a lifelong sports fan, it breaks my heart knowing this ugly truth but I'm afraid to say that the whole pro sporting arena is a sham and a charade and just another HUGE, GIANT corrupt industry.",

What matters is if Serena is trying to break the rules of her association that she previously agreed to, and would be aware of having played in the association a long time. Is it okay for women to break the rules they agree to just because they are women? Of course not, but that's what she is trying to do and that's all it amounts to. \nIf the women really want equality with men, let them play in the men's league and let the men wipe the floor with all of them but the testosterone freaks.",

I think what's not obvious is that Ramos was verbally abused for much longer than \"those men who said worse things to him.\" Serena's continued abuse finally made him give the 3rd viiolation.  Some other umpires and TV commentators were saying that Ramos should have given Serena a \"soft warning\" that she's getting close to another violation. Sure, that could have happened but - - - can you imagine if you were Ramos getting all that abuse - and would you have had the peace of mind to think of a soft warning [especially when, at one point, he told her to not talk to her]?    This was Serena's worse display of negativity yet!",

From the camera point of view it is clear that instructions were given whether or not she wanted them is something else. Her Coach gave her instructions which is against the rules and she got penalized for it. The fact Serena talks about being a mom and never cheating is just bullshit. She couldn't handle the heat and blew up towards the empire. Very disgraceful, disrespectful and she owes that empire an apology. I think she should get fined big money for throwing lies towards the empire when he just made a right call. If anyone is a victim it is the ref, being humiliated and being walked over because you mean less in tennis than she does. I'm a sore loser as well and often think my opponent doesn't deserve it because I didn't play to the fullest of my potential but making such outrageous calls is just way beyond unsportmanship. She was a hot mess and should be fined for it.",

She is competing at a very high athletic standard and when people get argumentative in those circumstances, the body chemistry is not very helpful. When competing, the confrontational behavior seems natural. A veteran of her experience must have handled this better, no doubt, but still, she isn't the worst I have seen when it comes to vulgarity. The length of her argument is by no means a factor. However, her accusation of Carlos was. Hence she had a point taken in a crucial way. Has Carlos did the same in every instance with men, history suggests, no. Hence there is some grey area in the <b> sexism </b>context. However, all credit to Osaka and Serena could have been much more graceful in supporting a young girl.",

After the match her reverse mood when she embraced her opponent and smiled as though being gracious was even worse. This is going to haunt her for the rest of her tennis career. Even when she wins another match, grand slam or not, the public will remember her shameful over the top tantrum and will be sparing in their applause.. She must be losing her sleep over this night after night. Moreover she had no right to disrespect her opponent by taking away from her the winning moment and spoiling it for her. Sorry Serina, we don't respect you anymore. You have lost your good reputation and the public's goodwill. The least you can now do is to write a note of apology to the umpire publicly,, as well as to  your opponent and to the public in general. That might soften your image a bit in the public eye, and ameliorate things for the future hopefully. As for the coach, what a deplorable character. He had no right to break the rules, and anyway Serena did not need his advice.",

Serena acted like an entitled middle school <b> brat </b>getting caught red-handed doing something wrong but is incapable of accepting responsibility for ANYTHING.  She owes the tennis world an apology.  Instead, the USTA board president gave a press release praising Williams' SPORTSMANSHIP?!?!?  WTF!!!!  Because she could chill out long enough to say something nice about her opponent at the award ceremony?!?!  That's not sportsmanship, it's self-preservation and self-aggrandizement by \"humbly\" putting the crowd in its place for following Willams' earlier porr sportsmanship lead??!?!? <b>  CRAZY</b> TOWN!!! If the USTA cared about the future of the sport instead of not pissing off their favorite athlete, they would have strongly denounced Williams' behavior and suspended her from upcoming tournaments. It's no<b> t sexis</b>m, it's eliteism, and Williams was a huge beneficiary in this case. Serena, ESAD.",

Again.\n\n [LINK] \n\n Osaka didn't have to apologize but she wasn't forced to, it was a Japanese thing to do.  She's not running for office, so if you all here like good character so much why is Trump in the White House?   She did wrong but you all forgave worst.",

It was a bad act of sportsmanship but we shouldn't forget that she has set very good examples in the game too and think of her personality  by just this act. Though she should apologize for this act as I find criticism good for realizing ppl the wrongs they have done.",

Sorry Serena, your openly admitting you saw your coach giving signals and the coach openly admits he was coaching, but i am to believe you didn't pay attention to the coaching signals, just the thumbs up. Then you threw a temper tantrum, breaking your racket, and got another warning. Then you belittled the ump, he had no choice but to properly discipline you. Accept defeat, you have no problem accepting a win, absolutely classless.",

            "commentText": "The whole way she acted was just wrong. Her throwing a temper tantrum led to the audience booing and acting out of place themself. Serena Williams should be a rolemodel, in this case it led to the entire audience being, sorry If I have to say it like that, a**holes. All of this could've been talked about after the game, no referee or umpire would ever take back their decision, no matter how much you feel it was unjustified, so discussing it on the cord should obviously not be your go to action. This is not a case of what other people do and did, but what you are not allowed to. Just cause some tennis players haven't been penalized for something which seemingly is the same situation you're in, doesn't justify you not being penalized for breaking the rules. This lack of patience, and inability to adress problems after the game, led to the audience being major douchebags.\n\nThe saddest thing is, because of that Osaka, a 20 year <b> old </b<b> >woman</b> who just won the US-Open for the first time, felt like she had to apologize for something she had worked on her entire life. This should've been a happy occasion. And Serene even praises the audience in the same moment. That's some major bollocks. The audience started to act like that because you clearly couldn't control your temper, and now you praise them for being a great audience? Yeah well they did what you wanted them to do I guess..",

You just said the rules are \"a player shall not receive coaching\" if you watched the match you would know that she did not receive  coaching she was on the opposite side of the court and he was seated several rows behind rather tall people so let's be honest did she receive the coaching? No is the answer it doesn't  matter  because what this remarkable <b> woman </b>has achieved and will only get better remember 1 year ago she was fighting for her life during childbirth. And she made it to the final  of 2 grand slams. If that is not remarkable idk what is. And gracious is the way Serena treated her opponent  by telling the crowd to STOP booing. It could have went a whole other  direction. Cudos to Serena Williams  the #G.O.A.T THE EMPRESS OF SPORTS. I LOVE YOU SERENA YOU SAY IT BEST \" You have<b>  nothing</b> to lose. Love always, Michael Page",

BTW this % business of equality is dividing the world into grossly unequal parts. Like men being pushed to relatively underdeveloped less land mass  containing southern hemisphere. I would prefer that as well, if women don't come there to claim equality there also after they finish ruining the civilization in northern hemisphere. I want peace between the <b> gender,</b> but that peace cannot be claimed by demonizing men for any chaos that plagues women's mind.",

If anyone is owed an apology (even though it is now too late for that) it is 1. Osaka and 2. Ramos who did an examplery job on the day.  \nWilliams ruined the joy and thrill of a well deserved win for Osaka.  I for one will no longer support williams. She is not representative of us women.

But, her childish behaviour on US Grand Slam and showing the true person (a mean, brutal and SICK) in her has made me change my mind about her.  Her skulduggery came out at last.  She is a very low down person inside.  She let the women tennis sport and her own community down by her meltdown under pressure, when one has to keep the self discipline as a world class sports person.",

            "commentText": "When I watched the video, I didn't take the boos as being for the umpire but for Serena. They didn't seem to boo until Serena start throwing a tantrum. This is a disgrace when athletes do this. One of the most important things in sports, in my opinion, is sportsmanship. Personally I don't like when players celebrate too much. There shouldn't be more than a few high fives or slaps on the back after a big play. These players are role models. The kids coming up are having enough trouble with being coddled by parents and teachers. It's even worse when their sports heroes throw fits and act like children. Serena made it even worse by playing the <b> gender </b>card. I saw the penalty stats for the past few years and men were penalized more in every category except one. Sometimes they were even penalized double what women were. I would think feminists would be pissed because Serena trivialized their cause by blaming<b>  sexism</b> instead of taking responsibility. Then again when did feminists ever want women to take responsibility. They want women to have all the perks of being a man except with all the responsibilities that come with them. They want to be firemen and police but don't want to be held up to the same standards. They want all the high paying and cushy jobs but want the dirty and dangerous jobs to stay majority male. They want equality in marriage but then still want alimony, full custody, and child support. They want to the same as men but then still expect men to pay for dinner and open doors. They want the right to vote but scream when someone brings up the idea that they pay for that vote with the draft like men. They want all this on top of all the perks they get for being women, for example control of conception. They fight against releasing a male birth control pill and absolutely hate the idea of a financial abortion for men. They want to be able to get pregnant even if the man doesn't and then control what happens to the pregnancy. If they decide to keep it even if the man didn't want it, he's required to pay for it. They want to hav<b> e se</b>x all they want and if the man doesn't meet their expectations afterward, they want the ability to take back consent after the fact. They want to lock a man who sleeps with a minor up and throw away the key but if they do it they should get a slap on the wrist, keep their teachers license, or not penalized at all. I went off an a rant but basically they want to have their cake and eat it too. Now that they got everything they've wanted, studies show they've gotten progressively more unhappy over the years. Also, more men are staying away from women because of all of the pitfalls of dating in a feminist culture. This cause all the good men to abandon ship leaving only the weasel male feminist types who will do whatever to get laid and the women cry about 'where have all the good men gone?'. Well you drove them away. Because of all this men are relying on porn, prostitution, <b> or s</b>ex robots and women are trying to shut that down. Some countries are even trying to institute a bachelors tax to force men to go back to women. Basically they'll do whatever it takes to coerce men into being their slaves. The real victims in all of this are the good women who can't find a good man because of the actions of a few or the real rape victims who aren't believed because of the tons of BS false rape accusations. Or the children who end up being raised without fathers because of these rules or they see their father get ruined and have to hear their mothers constantly tell them their father is a piece of shit. Many of these fathers have killed themselves because they can't take it. This creates young men who don't know how to act like a man. They either find father figures in gangs or they lash out because they didn't have a father to show them how to control their emotions. This is why 85% of inmates came from single mothers. It also creates women who don't have self confidence and don't find good relationships because they didn't have a father to show them what a good man is, Thus creating a vicious cycle of that will ultimately destroy the nuclear family thereby destroying the building block of western civilization which is ultimately their goal. It's one of the main stated goals of all Marxists. The Frankfort school said it, 2nd and 3rd wave feminists said it, and modern day SJWs say it. Jesus H Christ, tell us how you really feel! I'll end<b>  my cr</b>azy ranting tangent here.",

This is called \"entitlement\" and \"self victimization\" and not being accountable to her own actions.  Personally I think the $17K fine is a joke.  This amounts to a mere parking violation in Ms. William's world.  She should be bared from future tournaments until she had made full public apologies to the Umpire, USTA, US Open, Fans and her opponent to whom she already apologized, but for all the wrong reasons.",

I mean, it's not even a issue to be a sore loser since it's normal for elite athletes to always want to win BUT the real problem is not only insulting others, the umpire in this case, but also question the character of someone who's history speaks for itself on how he treats everyone with the same rigorous interpretation of the rules BUT still being fair, that's the problem",

Did Portuguese and Spaniards sit around and cry and play victim? no they moved on did what they could. What about all the slaves the arabs and jews once had? Jews and Arabs rarely ever get slandered for slavery and do you see the people that descend from their slaves crying about and making excuses? no you don't.

What does that have to do with anything? And then she threatens the umpire about never working her matches again. Hey, I'm going to take your livelihood away. How's that for good sportsmanship? Not. Williams IS a great athlete. She's won a lot of titles and deserved them, but her attitude has always stunk and always will.",

I lost a lot of respect and interest in Tennis because of this, and yeah, there are others who shouted as well like Jimmy Connors for one, maybe not as much but still happened.

That would have been funny considering the fact that Osaka grew up in the USA. Anyway, public wanted Serena to win so badly and lost all sense of objectivity. Futhermore what they didn't know is that the referee had to punish Serena BECAUSE of his coach. He was the one breaking the rule, but <b> nobody </b>knew that at that moment even Serena (based on her saying). The referee should have said \"I'm sorry u didn't do anything wrong but your coach did therefore following the rule I have to give you a sanction\". But it's hard to keep calm in ur mind and speak while an Amazon is yelling on you having lost all self control. The public didn't see anything and just emotionaly followed Serena because their hearts told them to do so.",

                    "commentText": "T NGUYEN,  Your idea is interesting and reasonable for an average umpire, perhaps. However, look at the videos more closely. Clearly Carlos IS responding to Serena's claim in her first retort to his Code Violation-Coaching - Warning. Again after the Code Violation-Racquet/Racket Abuse-Point Penalty Mrs. Williams, when Serena counters with \"Warning\", Carlos explains again to Serena, which Serena counters, disagrees, begins her onslaught and barrage, during which Carlos responds to Serena several times explaining. We do not hear his words. \nAlso note, Serena after her statement and claim to Carlos about the 'thumbs up' not as coaching but as encouragement 'Come On', she turned away, headed back toward the baseline, after a few steps away turns back toward Carlos shouts something in a strong tone, points her finger at him; Her words are not pickup by the microphones, but her non-verbal indicate something strong, perhaps intimidating-threatening. Her motion is not as strong nor anger was at the <b> woman </b>line judge in 2009, less, but along that line of similarity. Carlos ignores it.\nMany are quick to say about Carols Ramos known as a 'stickler' or 'strict' umpire. However, Carlos Ramos endures at least three separate onslaughts of verbal abuse. One after each code violation statement and penalty status. Each one is increasingly more abusive, with multiple abuses in each. After the third onslaught and barrage of verbal abuse finished, which contained intimidation, threat, demand of apology, questioning-refuting judgement and correctness, defamation of character ['liar' and 'thief'], did Carlos Ramos rule Code Violation-Verbal Abuse-Game Penalty. The discussion with Tournament Director Brian Earley is not audible [intentionally], but as it completes a few words of Brian saying \" ... okay then it's Verbal Abuse for 'thief'. Seems there was much more and maybe agreed to minimize it, else a greater penalty could be assessed as a Major Offence of 'Aggravated Behavior' and disqualification. Perhaps agreeing that with this game penalty, Serena will stop her tirade, the match will be ending soon, and minimize any worse detriment to the tournament, at least the match will complete in a closer to normal proceeding, not by default.",

She is product of very professional doping. Its similar to Norwegian skiers who have good connections to WADA so they benefit from special pharmacology. There are some leaks about strange behavior of Williams when employ\u00e9es of WADA came to check her (thats their duty). But because of dirty connections and support from US officials it was kept hidden until leak. She is a cheater.\nAlso her entitled childish behavior suggests that a lot in her tennis career was \"given\" to her. Well, you can hardly teach decency and respect to someone who is a doping product.",

Know wh<b> y blac</b>k people like myself who voted for Trump calls it \"Getting of the plantation\"? It's because now you democrats only see us as votes and use us to feel better about yourselves as if we are lesser beings that need your help 24/7. The world democrats want to create with the sjw and censoring shit is very close to what the Nazi's used to do which is another reason I find it so funny you guys like to call people Nazi's. Funnily enough you guys also are the first ones to call someone<b>  a raci</b>st, sexist, or homophobe just because you didn't like what they said while at the same time secretly being the things you call people. Democrats are the worse kind of people.",

I might also add too that naturally assuming that I could only be American is quite an insular attitude and in some ways a form of \"<b> racism\"</b> in itself.\n\nThe trouble with those on the political right is that they think they have a monopoly on things like condemning crime and upholding law and order, a dislike for overly politically correct attitudes and showing patriotism, probably because they collectively place \"the left\" in one all encompassing bag. Yet if anyone tries to do that to those on the right and tags them by the most extreme and insane brigade from the right, then they will be the first to protest. \n\nYes there are plenty of liberals and those on the left who like to unjustifiably play the victim via the<b>  race</b> o<b> r sexis</b>m card, yet equally there are plenty of liberals or those on the left who will condemn that because it devalues it when it actually happens. Just as there are plenty on the right who at times will try to unjustifiably explain away any genuinely discrimination of any form, as if none ever exists.\n\nAlso as<b>  a bla</b>ck person, unless you are worth millions and don't really care about others but yourself then voting Republican is like turkeys voting for Christmas if you really think Trump and Republicans value you and have your best interests at heart.\n\nAmway, my original point was that it's is total nonsense to say \"Liberal is short <b> for rac</b>ist\" as if there is only one kind of liberal, especially when as I alluded to above, the KKK are hardly colourblind and definitely are neither liberal nor of the left of the political spectrum.",

It's not <b> crazy </b>to assume these two things. If you are not an American democrat then I am sorry for assuming you are the worse thing in our country right now. I actually live here so  my opinions on the matter I think hold a bit more weight than someone that doesn't.  You don't know what it's been like here in the last 10  years. It's gotten really bad.

The anger and injustice that I am sure she actually felt she long ago realised she could use to either get a crowd on her side, fire up her own game and take the rhythm out of the opponent or both. It's called gamesmanship and she, like other superstars who should know better (Neymar, Ronaldo, McEnroe etc..), has tried to cover up her own failings with whataboutism. It's a politicians game. When things are going against you, find a distraction, put your opponent off, take them outside the game and maybe, just maybe you can come out victorious. \n\nSo <b> sexism?</b> Really. The points were taken from Serena and given to.... a man? Actually, I can't be bothered to get into that side of the debate because that is exactly what someone like Serena wants. Talk about the controversy that she, alone, created and forget about the fact that she was outplayed by a superior player. \n\nWell Done Osaka - you overcame the toughest hurdle out there, both athletically and mentally.",

The rules are well known by the players. Admonishment, point, game, and finally you risk being defaulted. Ask Nick Kyrgios about his meltdown experiences on today's tour when he gets out of line. Ask Nadal about his experience in this year's U.S. Open when he got out of line. Unlike Kyrgios and Williams, Nadal knows when to shut up, be a professional, and get back to competing. \n\nis the rule against coaching outdated, probably. But the rule is in place now and Williams knows she is responsible for her team's behavior. Instead of returning to a model of veteran professionalism, she chose to personalize the admonishment and martyr herself to hide the fact she felt she was going to lose. Williams could have pointed at her coach wagged her finger NO! and apologized for his actions. That would have ended it with the referee. \n\nBut Serena being Serena, she has to blow it out of portion. When she smashed her racquet I knew, from having watched her for decades, that more was coming. She berated the umpire numerous times on a worldwide broadcast. How could he rule anything different? The attempt to demonstrate bias by dragging out decades <b> old </b>tolerated bad boy behavior is silly. How about we use the standards of the 1930s & 40s? Say Bill Tilden with the world celebrating his tennis excellence while turning a<b>  blind</b> eye to his open pedophila. If Nastase, Connors, or McEnroe were to try their antics on today's tour they would be sanctioned just a quickly as Serena Williams. \n\nWilliams threw the second set away with her actions and paid token pennies in fines when compared to her 2nd place prize money for a very poor performance while robbing a very fine youn<b> g woma</b>n of her golden moment. So will Serena Williams close out her career allowing us all to remember her substantial accomplishments or will she leave us with the image of outrageous adult tantrums?",

And so sorry for Naomi.  When you are competing at that level there is a lot adrenal flowing, and that makes  for great competition and sometimes less than great behavior  But it is true, that when men exhibit this behavior, sometimes it is not only excused, it is heralded.  A very difficult call now.  In the past it would be an easy call--any<b>  woman</b> that did this was an animal  A man that did this, well it is just boys being boys.",

Those are all code violations. She got docked the point because it was her second code violation and a game because it was her third code violation. To say other men players are not similarly penalised is false. If those code violations are their first. the players will only get a warning. How is it no one is speaking on this? To claim <b> sexism </b>and<b>  racism</b> is ludicrous as her opponent was also <b> a woma</b>n of mixed parentage. Let's call<b>  a spa</b>d<b> e a sp</b>ade. She was beaten fairly by a better player on that day.",

By someone who should be a role model, which she is not. Serena has always acted like trash when things don't go her way . Her huge EGO needs to be gone from tennis. Serena is a sore loser. The Umpire Ramos has did what he's suppose to do. Serena is making excuses for what she knows is wrong, calling it fighting for \"women's rights!\" This is not your first time bullying people. Shame!\nSerena, if I may add, wasn't on the court to \"fight for women's rights and equality.\" She was on the court fighting for a 3.8 million dollar check and her 24th gland-slam title. Naomi was playing at a much higher level than she was and that frustrated her more than the umpire did. Had Serena been playing well, her coach wouldn't have had a need to use hand signals, and she wouldn't have smashed her racquet. It was Naomi's incredible performance that brought out Serena's despicable behavior.\nshe was pulling another stunt today, got called out and then played the victim card and cried....she's a vile person. she's awful! arrogant, rude, no manner, no rule, no respect.",

Serena is a cheat, pretending to b<b> e a wo</b>man in a female competition. Already had the upper hand in strength being a man. That is what HE gets. Sore loser for sure.  Male anger shining through. It's discrimination letting Serena play again<b> st a w</b>oman, now that's true discrimination.",

Big <b> buck </b>sporting franchises make trans-gender cheating very attractive to those at the lower levels of the socio-economic spectrum.  As a retired umpire  I hope that the best possible outcome of this tirade could be just what we  need to address the weakness that trans-sexualism exploits.\nI look forward to their next match-up.",

Smashing rackets, verbally abusing the refs: Beyond unsportsmanlike behavior.  Serena, for the most part, has always been professional and non-confrontational.  John on the other hand???  Ha!

No wonder she wins so many matches - it's completely unfair!  It's like an adult play against a child!  And she claims she was playing for her daughter - it was all fake!  The biggest lie is she stole the joy Naomi Osaka's win to the point that the winner is feeling like she needs to apologize for winning?  WTF?",

No one gives a Good job, I agree, Things are going great...thumbs up with their hands open, parallel, moving forward & back repeatedly, and his facial expressions that he did with it.  He said she probably didn't see it, but SHE said she saw his friendly innocent non-coaching 'thumbs up', which I always thought required only closed fist(s).  One hand or two is fine, but open hands and moving back & forth several times?  Nope.  Unless he's from some culture that does that for an innocent approval hand signal (which I don't think is really coaching, borderline).  I heard that in Japan, our OK hand signal means Pay me back my money you owe me, or Give me money.",

The umpire was in the right throughout the ridiculous show being put up by the returning champion. And I can't believe that she used being a mother to justify her shit fit.

This particular match she was being completely outplayed and she knew it - what better way to cover her own inadequacy than to make it look like she was somehow being \"cheated\" (she was guilty of every single thing she was penalized for). When I see Serena Williams now, the first word that pops into my head is \"classless\" (and steroids, but that's a whole different story)...",

            "commentText": "Very objective piece. One thing you missed: Ramos was over the top and excessive in his penalties. And EVERYONE is unanimous on that. Some have argued that it is up to his discretion and hes not wrong and that the cumulative nature of the sanctions are caution enough, but they all say it was too much, even if he had the right. And that right is very debatable on the first and last sanction. Which you very aptly covered.\n\nThe fact that there are many men who have done more for extended periods of time is what led to Serena's accusation. <b> Sexism?</b> Who knows, but we do know he has treated men in EXACTLY the same situation differently. Could be<b>  racism</b>, could be American hate, could be Serenaism, who knows. But it is undeniably disparate treatment, thus her shock and outrage. The same shock and outrage we see in every sport from highly competitive elite athletes.\n\n The Williams sisters ushered in a change in the WTA from dainty tennis to powerful athletic, competitive tennis. When they first overheard volleyed, smashed returns and did body serves it was considered offensive and out of control too. Women's tennis just needs to decide if it wants to be a powerful competitive, sweaty sport or an elegant, country club, social game. Define it. Let everyone know what it is. Set the rules clearly and administer the rules equally. Serena believes she's playing a high level sport and thus is entitled to argue at a high level as all the other helmet throwing, mouth guard throwing, dugout emptying high level players.",

            "commentText": "Im sick of hearing \"he took a game\" an umpire does not have the power to \"take a game from her\" he only has the capability to award code violations. Plenty of male players have said worse and plenty of players have received code violations for it (that is all an umpire can award) from then on the rules stipulate the penalty given the number of code violations. 1st = warning, 2nd = point penalty, 3rd=game penalty, 4th=game penalty or disqualification. \nSaying I've never seen an umpire take a game from a man even when they've said worse only means they know to bite their tongue and apply some self-control after the 2nd violation. It's also important to remark most umpires are told their <b> blind,</b> stupid, assholes, retards, that they couldn't tell their ass from their mouth, etc. plenty and they have pretty think skin when it comes to being told things like that but it is rare for a player to attack their character directly, and that rarely ends well. Let's frame it this way, most insults directed at referee reference incompetence, \"you are one of these things, therefore, you can't do your job right and cant realize you were wrong on x call\" these, most referees will give you a pass on, unless they are especially offensive. Other complaints and insults like the ones in Serena's case refer back to open dishonesty \"you know you are wrong on this call and you are doing it on purpose because you're _________\" these referees don't usually take very well (when was the last time any sports player said \"how much did you get paid?\" and got away with it?).",

Would he have given her a game penalty if this was her first response, ie, no rant beforehand? Probably not. It was because her rant was ongoing, vile and abusive.

I honeslty think the whole serena thing was a mixture of it being Serena and Ramos. \n\nSerena is known for having tantrums and losing her cool on the court. As with ANY sport, if you widely known for something then you are far more likely to be called for it. (E.G NHL's Tom Wilson is known for dirty hits, so he gets penalised for hits left and right even when they are perfectly legal ones). \n\nRamos is also known for being stingy with the rules. Male, Female, <b> Black,</b> White or<b>  Alien</b>. Ramos follows the rule books very strictly. Mix them together and the chances of what happened happening is so high. Serena got what she deserved. She was way out of line.",

And she is an American, and America has a lot of tennis players and fans.  \n\nUnfortunately Serena is often not very likable.  That is something that can, however, be overcome if one is willing to listen to others and make some minor concessions with respect to their outward personality.  She has tried.  She is often gracious to a fault winning AND losing.\n\nThis display, however, was atrocious.  She acknowledged she'd seen her coach and his gestures, at which point it is the chair's call on whether it was coaching or not.  At that point it's just a warning.  No different than what you get for hitting a ball into the stands intentionally.  She could have just made her complaint and got back to playing tennis.  But she did not.  \n\nFrom there on out, one can only guess what was going on in her head.  She was either really out of control, or she was staging all of it to try to disrupt her opponent.  Both of course reflect poorly on her.  WORST OF ALL, she tried to pin it all on <b> sexism.</b>  And most of the leftist media is trying to spin that as well, fortunately with little success.  \n\nKudos to the tennis world for standing by the code and rules, even when the number one female tennis player of all time is concerned.",

I can say this I'm not going to support any of her sponsors .. IF she keeps on this women's equality nonsense....

That's just classless. Djokovic had to shut the crowd up when he beat Roddick few years ago and suddenly he was very disliked. People make calls during the rallies, or just make noise, they regularly scream a microsecond before someone is ready to serve. This year even Wimbledon crowd made purposeful noises when Djokovic was beating Edmunds. For this crowd to support Serena so vocally is just an example of their mentality- and by the way, I really like Serena but that day she misbehaved.",

She truly believes she should not be held to the same rules as other players even though there is 100%, undeniable and concrete video evidence and confession of her coach and video and audio of her clearly breaking multiple rules against the umpire.  And, yet, she plays the victim, as usual.  Sexist,<b>  racist</b>, blah blah blah.  The usual buzz words of people who refuse to take responsibility for their actions and blames everyone else.  She should have had the entire match taken away from her and fined millions of dollars.  If I was her sponsor, I'd drop her like a sack of dog crap.  Of which she is, to me.  And don't overlook how she took the award's ceremony that was supposed to be for Osaka and stepped in to give herself more of the spotlight.",

She is now, and always has been a classless, entitled diva who rarely acknowledges her opponents when she loses, makes excuses for those losses and blames other factors for her poor play. I hope this public display of horrible sportsmanship is a signal that here career is over.",

The stupidest thing she said was when she said about her daughter. Really what the fuck does her daughter have to do with anything. Fuck u SerenaWilliams, u lost alot of fans. The tennis world doesnt revolve around u bitch. Rules are the fucken rules, and yes even u have to play by them.",

Stating that because you are<b>  black</b> you are probably a criminal is no different to your statements and even those who are slightly tolerant towards those types of comments would probably judge it to be<b>  'racis</b>t'. You even say that in your life experien<b> ce bla</b>ck people are aggressive and violent - which obviously doesn't include <b> all bl</b>ack people. So your assumption, that because a perso<b> n is b</b>lack <b> and a </b>woman they will be aggressive, regardless of how you came to that conclusion, is a rather o<b> bvious </b>racist statement. \n\nBut then you double down and your true 'colour' shines through a<b> ccusin</b>g black people of entitleme<b> nt as </b>if black people somehow have an advantage in this world. You clearly have a pro<b> blem w</b>ith black people - regardless of who they are. Bad behaviour is bad behaviour - Serena being an example of a person who behaves very badly and aggressively. But are therefore Sloane Stevens and Madison Keys automatically as badly behaved? You must see how your argument falls apart so easily. So just accept it<b> . You h</b>ave racist tendencies.

You watched Serena and made a sweeping statement about <b> black </b>women - all 20 million of them(or 500 million if you include the rest of the world). Now you pull it down to the generous 'most' - which means that you have had experience that spans more than 10 million<b>  black</b> women. In your next post you might be magnanimous enough to go down to 'many' and if pushed maybe even 'some' - but I have a sneaky suspicion you don't believe that. \n\nThis is the classic path o<b> f racis</b>m - the heartfelt comment said in anger comes first - which usually has t<b> he raci</b>st remarks in them.

Are you not aware that you are trying to defend your comments as not being <b> racist </b>while just continuing to make more such remarks? Are you aware that this is what you are doing? \n\nJust curious. Are you an authority on the<b>  black</b> community's behavioural patterns throughout the US? Have you got some stats on this entitlement stuff or just a hunch from the handful of examples you claim to have witnessed? You see, this is where the problem lies because if you were an authority on this you wouldn't be saying the above things. \n\nThis is what ignorance looks like. \n\nBut maybe your idea of ignorance is different. Maybe you think someone who challenges your personal experience as not being the objective truth is being ignorant in the sense that I, in this case, am ignorant of your specific observations. But that's where you've got it wrong. Your assumption that - let's get this right -  most libera<b> l blac</b>k American women (so roughly 7 million people let's say) - behave as you say is, by definition, an ignorant assumption. You have no idea if this is true. You also misjudge what is often<b>  a bla</b>ck person's sentiment that they deserve an entitlement to equality as someone who is unfairly manipulating history for their benefit. It's like the people who say Obama's skin colour helped him become president when instead he had to overcome this fact to be successful. It's a glaring misunderstanding of history, anthropology, sociology <b> and com</b>mon sense. \n\nIn the same way - just because you are making these ignorant comments about<b>  the b</b>lack community does not mean that I will assume that all white people are like that. Because why say something so ridiculous. Are you able to see that your comments only further enforce the notion of the ridiculous? \n\nI have a digger on standby.",

You are accusing <b> black </b>people of not 'earning their shit' as opposed to... what? You, personally? So in that case not white people in general but just you are better than<b>  black</b> people. That still makes you put yourself above another community based o<b> n rac</b>e.  \n\nAnd I'm not speaking 'for' a group but more about society and our place in it. I'm merely saying that no individual can presume to know what an entire group is like. And I'm saying that what tolerance is - as opposed to prejudice - is the ability to not make sweeping assumptions about a whole community of people based on one's narrow personal experience. It's like assuming that the headline news is the only thing happening at the moment and that one story about one individual should define all - sorry, 'most' other people similar to that person. \n\nSo what I'm trying to get through to you is that instead of walking around with this automatic association in your mind between t<b> he bla</b>ck community and the various derogatory things you have said - be open to the idea that s<b> ome bl</b>ack women are like Serena (to refer back to the tennis) - entitled, spoilt, sore losers; and others are like Sloane Stevens - dignified, humble and honourable.

A great player does not have to win at any cost. A great player does not cheat. Serena William's was cheating by getting signals from her coach. She then claim she wasn't cheating and she'd rather lose than cheat, she lied. Then when found out, oh, everybody does that (ask Lance Armstrong about that one)., sorry., she can't have it both way. Her actions brought the game of tennis into disrepute and for, me that deserves a more just punishment.",

If a guy had broken his racket in a match, the punishment would have been lesser and the comments would be in the lines of 'the passion of the game...'\n\n2. If a guy would have argued with the umpire, the conversation would be different, but because she's a <b> woman </b>she gets criticized as 'unable to control her temper.'\n\n3.Since when are umpires so touchy-feely. Other players have done worse or said worse comments and the umpires just let it go.\n\n4.I love the fact that she is the one penalized and chastised for standing up for herself, but no one seems to understand that the one really at fault here is her coach. The big head decided it was ok to coach her, knowing it was against the rules, and she gets the short end of the stick for his actions.\n\n5. Sure,  Serena could have handled it better, but then again, it would have not been necessary had the coach sat on his little hands and let her play.\n\nI honestly think she would have been ok with losing the match to her great opponent Osaka, but the issue is not the loss of the match, but the fact that because of a man, she gets punished by a man and then gets criticized by all other men as a<b>  woman</b> unable to 'control her temper.' That's right, because unfortunately, some men are threatened by a stron<b> g woma</b>n.\n\nSerena, we love you, and know it was complete BS.",

            "commentText": "THIS IS SO CLEAR!!  1) The men had an overwhelming majority of code violations overall in the tournament.  2) The 2nd, 3rd, etc code violation for any player DURING THE SAME MATCH will result in a more significant penalty (e.g. warning, point penalty, game penalty...a fact Serena knows \"in her sleep!\").  3) Her behavior that \"she doesnt cheat\" is a thinly veiled lie as it implies she NEVER saw the NUMEROUS coaching signals from her box (Now, we all know how often players look to their box --- pretty much after every point? Yeah, I'm gonna stand by that estimate).  So, are we to believe that with her knowledge of the rules,  her unavoidable awareness that her coach was signalling (which he immediately admitted post-match), her decision to NEVER GESTURE TO HER COACH TO STOP (Nadal has done this, for example, MANY, times), that her reactions to the 2nd and 3rd code violations were authentic, sincere, and surprising?  Give me a break: this,  IMO, would constitute an equal insult to Serena's knowledge of Grand Slam rules.  4) Finally, a logical overview of this situation is not a contrast of what men and women get code violations for.   The data is clear:  <b> sexism </b>cannot be supported by the statistical records of Serena 's generation including the ten years previous.   THIS SITUATION IS SIMPLY AND ABSOLUTELY ABOUT A PLAYER \"EARNING\" MULTIPLE CODE VIOLATIONS IN A SINGLE MATCH --- THUS THE PROGRESSIVE IMPACT OF THE PENALTIES.   SHE KNEW THIS; SHE LOST CONTROL; SHE CHOSE A VERBAL ABUSE THAT HITS SQUARELY ON A SPECIFIED VIOLATION (LIAR, THIEF ----\u300b  RULE: \"DISPARAGEMENT.....HONESTY\").   SERENA IS A TERRIBLE LOSER!!  LOOK AT CLIPS FROM HISTORICAL FOOTAGE OF LOSING ON COURT AND POST - GAME PRESS CONFERENCES.   DO YOU SEE A \"GOOD LOSER---SPORTSMANSHIP UNDER DEFEAT?\"  I CLEARLY DO NOT.",

It was her fault she didn't know how to do her's.  The mere notion that her coach would imply that Serena might not have known the implications of throwing her racket down in an Open match is absolutely laughable.  How long has Serena been playing tennis?  And you are going to imply she may not know basic rules of the game?  STFU and go home... losers.  Losers.

And her comment about male players doing the same thing or worse and getting away with it and not getting a game taken away is completely off kilter. First off, most males have short outbursts but they stop pretty quickly, she kept going on and on. Secondly, most male players yell about the call and they try to argue why they thought the call should have been different, Serena went straight to attacking the character of the umpire, most male players do not do that. And third, yeah make players do this and they DO get a warning, except usually it's not their third warning and the only reasons Serena got a game taken away is because it was her THIRD warning. Most men know when to stop so they don't have that happen and Serena has been pro for 20 years, she knows the rules. And last like you said, it doesn't matter what other umpires have done. She brings it up like men do things worse than her and don't get penalized and that because she got penalized it must be because of <b> sexism </b>but that does not being into account WHO is doing the penalizing. Ramos is known for being a stickler for the rules and he has always upheld them very strictly. There may be other umpires who are more relaxed and who would have let Serena's thing go, but that doesn't matter. What matters is consistency with each INDIVIDUAL umpire to tell if it's<b>  sexism</b>. Ramos is extremely consistent. Serena has completely lost any respect I've ever had for her",

Her level of competitive drive,  perseverance, and single -handedly changing the style of woman's tennis is <b> nothing </b>short of generational.  Having said that, she was blatantly wrong in this case, and further tried to change the narrative so that the radical left media (and virtue signalling activisits) would jump on board with the accusation of<b>  sexism</b>.  I am very disappointed in this blatant example of poor sportsmanship.  Not only is she not owed an apology, she needs to apologize to Naomi Osaka & Japan for ruining this special moment.",

Naomi is similar to Sloane Stevens, they have that one bad match during a tournament that knocks her out. Good for her she put it all together and won. Serena was under a lot of pressure and it took her over in the final. Same thing happened when beaten by Vinci, and Clijsters at the same tournament on different years. Serena went somewhat overboard but have witnessed much worse matches with players throwing tantrums. She got penalized for in proper behavior, she lost! End of story people, I have to read this on my news feed over and over this week and this whole thing is stupid and wish people would stop making a  fuss out of this. More important things going on in world than Serena Williams! Hopefully she will tie or beat M. Court's record another time.",

The fact that some other umpire may not have penalized some man is irrelevant. Also I have trouble with my temper playing games like tennis, but it would never cross my mind to say the sorts of things Serena said. Having a temper tantrum is bad enough, but verbal abuse is unconscionable. It doesn't matter if others have done worse. That's an absurd defense, as is the statement that \"I'm fighting for women's rights.\" I'm still a Serena fan though - I love her as a tennis player.",

Furthermore, Serena had a point behind the men and <b> woman </b>comparison when it comes to penalisation of verbal disputes. But, nevertheless, adding her child to defend her argument was completely uncalled for. I think Serena and the Umpire could learn from this mistake, and tie loose ends at both ends. But Naomi Osaka was the flower on the AAS unwilling to blossom, under the shade of Serena. We should forget the argument and focus on Naomi as she deserves the victory and the title, despite the major impact the stipulations around the on court has created....congrats Ms.Osaka.",

She isn't the only <b> woman,</b> from what I've seen the game is flooded with on court hysterics and hissy fits and verbal attacks against the ref.  It is sexist in the sense that men get away with worse and more often.  It is true that aggression and anger are more expected and accepted from men.  If the rules are expected to be respected then the game needs to address this inconsistency.  A rule needs to be upheld 100% of the time and currently its a farce because sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.  If Osaka was being coached throughout the match, then how on earth can only Serena be penalised?  It isn't good enough to say that the ref didn't see it.  Didn't he?  Or has the Serena bias built up to such an extent that people just want to see her lose no matter what?",

Osaka will recover and go on doing what she will. the people? the piranhas in us human beings will in time have that voracious hunger die down after feeling full...and they'll wait until the next FEED comes around as available. why, who knows, but in time, give it time, the next feeding frenzy may come to be the little Osaka dynamo, when her time to err and fail comes around. i'd damned well bet on this!!!!! for we're all SO human after all... hey? ; )",

The big BUT here is her lack of humility of admitting her mistakes later. She's no victim here... she's the aggressor who transgressed the rules once and again during that match and repeatedly verbal-abused of th'innocent judge. Shame she's more into a political victim suit instead of of one saying the truth and being a good sport. Sad.",

She saw her coach and after the Umpire called the penalty for coaching..as he was still making the motion with his hands.. So that explains why she saw the thumbs up. And becsuse they are honest people..the coach admitted that ALL coaches do hand signals.. but Serena did not see him. (All of which is debatable)  I believe she did not until after the Umpire gave her the penalty.. So... After all that... Things snowballed out of control. Serena did not handle things well... The Umpire was punitive by calling the coaching violation. Funny, how with all the coverage and cameras in Authr Ashe Stadium... No one has shown a shot of Serena actually looking at her coach at the same time of him giving the hand signals occuring before the Umpire gave her the violation.",

But what people fail to realize is that perhaps 1. the verbal abuse was their first offense (so they just get off with a warning as per rule), or 2. the verbal abuse, as mentioned in this video, were short outbursts that the ump was able to let go. On the other hand, Serena ran with her mouth for a good few minutes there before Ramos has had enough and called her 3rd violation. \n\ni'm all for fighting for equality, but please, let's not call something for what it isn't. As a world-class athlete, Serena should be the first to hold herself in high standards, because crying foul and saying, \"why are there other [men] who can get away with worse but i can't?\" for me is just <b> lame.</b> why even would you be committing the same violation as what those [men] did in the first place?",

He goes to all the trouble to make this play by play video telling us how it all went down but he doesn't know the difference between a penalty and a warning! He keeps referring to the warning that Serena received as a penalty he's referred to the warning as a penalty five times! Five times he referred to a warning as a penalty a warning and a penalty are worlds apart a penalty actually cost something a warning doesn't cost anything! This is really ridiculous how all these people who don't know anything about tennis or making these videos reporting to us what happened! I would never attempt to do a story on a lacrosse game I don't even know if they're called games or matches! When you're talking about lacrosse I don't know anything about lacrosse so if there was a lacrosse controversy I would be a listener! But these dumbshit's like this guy right here who I wasn't watching this doesn't understand the rules doesn't know what happened it's going to make this long video explaining to the world what happened when there's already 500 other videos explaining what happened to the world Dofus! Why don't you shut your stupid about what happened! Or if you insist on opening up your stupid pie hole at least get your facts straight! A penalty and a warning or two different things",

She is a real loser and a reproach to the profession. It is because, in her mind, it is all about her. But the clincher was when she started invoking he motherhood, this is feminism at its zenith. She lost and she had to escape that fact. You know, when will there come a time when such frauds will no longer be tolerated.

No one likes losing, some people feel they let themselves and others down, they feel deep disappointment and sadness. But when someone identifies one way or another with losing the way Serena did, there's a problem... That's when you HATE losing and you have to do something about it...\n\n I don't think it's any exaggeration to point out the potential for violence here... In fact this is something I read other females players talk about as being the reason they feel intimidated by her. As in \"scared\" and/or \"guilty\" for beating her. This is one of the classic dynamics created within the narcissist field/environment.\n\nI'll leave it there.. I'm just tired of seeing her vicious manipulations and people calling it something else...(afraid and intimidated they will be accused of being <b> race </b>motivated) Please, enough of \"you wronged me and you owe me an apology\" BS. Nope.. you cheated (amazing she used her daughter as a reason for never cheating and having impeccable character...) \n\nI mean, just priceless, and it couldn't have happened to a more manipulative FRAUD of a person; who wasted no time to accuse the umpire of being a \"thief\" (who was right to make the call in the first place) and threatened with taking his job away in future matches... There, the great Serena defined. I don't give a flying F---- how many grand slams she won... She's a s----t human being, who has repeatedly displayed her ghetto intimidation tactics and the \"How dare you wrong me !!!!!\" BS judgments and accusations.",

But let's just say it did happen. Does anybody think Serena would have taken up the supposed \"women's issue\" for Osaka? No, what you are seeing is Serena gladly taking the win and it NOT EVEN OCCURRING to Serena that there could be a women's issue. Serena lied to herself and to everyone ...the really sad thing is that MORONIC American crowd actually bought it! In the end I could not work out who disgusted me more, Serena or the crowd.",

Then Serena doubles down in the press conference, and the media heads interviewing her were too frightened to call her out on her behaviour, tippy tapping around the subject. Finally, idiots like Billie Jean King seem to think Serena can do no wrong and this really was all about <b> sexism </b>- no calling her out about her behaviour. Thankfully Navratilova at least managed to be more balanced. And people looking in on this, like the people in the comments section here, think - what the f*** is going on in this world that Serena can act like a bully and an entitled<b>  brat</b> and get praised for it?",

I mean maybe in France or wherever he's from it is but that's not how we do it from where I'm from. Doesn't really matter either way as she just got warned about it. The Ump was just saying, \"don't do that anymore\" basically. She then mouthed off about it and then smashed her racket a short time later. She was trying to force the Ump into taking it back but he's the wrong Ump to try that shit with and it only made it worse. \n\nPersonally, I think she knew she was going to lose and she used the penalties as a way out. Just my opinion but watching the early part of the match, it sure looked like Serena just didn't have it that night and Osaka did.",

            "commentText": "So let me get this straight! Ramos hasn't fined men in the past for their foul mouths, but you state that Serena deserved her because she didn't back down! That in and of itself is a double standard! You're are judging an athletes interactions on nitpick points! Serena didn't tell the umpire to go fuck himself, which several male players have admitted to and not gotten fined. Second, the umpire can decide to give a person a warning, a fine, give set or points or all three. In this case, he decided to give the tripple whammy. Meanwhile, when men play, it is business as usual and the male players can do what they want. I don't mind Ramos having a reputation for being a hardliner! What I take issue with is that he does it more to females than to males! That a player got away with the f bomb or worse is inconsequential in this argument if a person is watching the video. \n\nSecond, Naomi may play for Japan, but she is also Haitian. She is the victim in this  because she got fallout for Venus's poor sportsmanship and Ramos's sexists calls. That said, I watched the after match interviews with Naomi. I want to call Naomi's BS right here and now! Before I continue, I am not trying to make Naomi responsible for Serena's actions. Let's get this straight. However, what I saw at Naomi's press conference disturbed me. Naomi denied hearing or understanding what the debate was about! Nor did she make any comment about the situation or defend Serena for trying to help her out! \n\nWOW! You see Naomi is playing her Japanese kawaii card (kawaii means cuteness) while scheming over the fact that her father is Haitian. You see it's easier for her to do that because the majority make it so hard for people of color! When Naomi performed kawaii, she insulted Serena! Everything Serena is fighting for or has fought for, Naomi along with other players will benefit from. Case in point: Naomi is considered the victim, which should be. Yet, if the umpire association does indeed find Ramos has  been unfair in his handling of matches, he along with others will get a clear message to clean up their acts. Speaking of umpire associations, I don't mind that the UA took supported Remos. That said, the UA should also make it a point to monitor their umpires to insure there is no misconduct on their part. \n\nReturning to kawaii, because Naomi plays her kawaii card, her voice is taken from her and she is made into a puppet of what the establishment wants: a person who simply plays tennis and does not demand anything from professional tennis associations who may or may not have her best interest in mind. By staying silent, Naomi may want to appear gracious, polite and sportsmanlike, but the truth is that she hurt women, especially Asian women by living the stereotype of what the public expects out of them: quiet, polite, obedient! Because of these things, the public is more accepting of her and empathizes with her despite the personal slight against Serena, who has been made public enemy number one in all this. \n\nI'd love to see what would happen if Naomi was playing for her father's country of Haiti or if Naomi had a bad day and openly argued with an umpire. Would the public be so understanding of Naomi whose homeland is the poorest country and has the highest poverty, AIDS and illiteracy rates? When I see Naomi walking around the ghettos of Haiti, giving tennis lessons, I'll be the first to apologize for under estimating her! Until then, you need to give Serena props for standing up to unfair treatment. That said. I don't like any athlete having tantrums on the court including Serena. It makes them look immature. However, that <b> old </b>game where  Naomi is an angel and Serena the devil needs to end here and now! When Naomi opens her mouth to talk about being treated unfairly is the minute the establish will say she is spoilt and entitled--just like Serena. And this is what Serena and many people want to end so women will be treated equally, because we are not.",

            "commentText": "WOW this video clearly explains all sides, was in-depth, showed the entirety of the situation, and addressed the incorrect sexist angle Serena decided to take, accurately. (Stephen A Smith made a good response video to this incident as well)\n\n I've done my own digging and reached the same conclusions this video made, when considering the strict umpire, the code violations, diminishing Osaka's historic victory, etc. I think if Serena was able to discern that the warning for cheating was inevitable, when the ump called it, she could've stayed more focused. I think in her situation I would've reacted the same, b/c I would feel mischaracterized and clearly deny something I'm not doing. But from this strict ump's view the coach made clear coaching signals and she even admitted to seeing a thumbs up. I don't believe Serena the tennis goat would rely on coaching, but the ump operated within the rules. The ump has that luxury to make that call, if she could've taken that as just a warning and moved on I think she would've maintained her composure. \n\nAlso with that initial warning i think there's a clip where Serena and the ump came to an \"Understanding\", they both said they understood each other but I think Serena mistook that for the ump retracting the first warning. Which would explain why she got confused about the point awarded after racket abuse. She would've thought that her racket abuse, would be her first warning.\n\nThis ump is a veteran, well known for being by-the-book, and because she did call him a thief, his third violation was correct. However, since every ump is different, one could argue that this ump could've let go of that 'thief comment' because that third violation would result in a game being awarded, in a Grand Slam final. Not only is that devastating but it rarely happens in Grand Slams, and I think for good reason. Stephen Smith also made a good point that an athlete prepares for the opponent and the ump. \n\nThere have also been studies that talk about this 'uncontrollable rage' athletes can experience while in the game that may affect their behavior and performance. I think it is wrong/unprofessional for a professional athlete to succumb into this intense emotion, but it can also be very difficult to control this rage. Examples: losing in a video game and breaking your property or when Tyson bit off an ear. It think it starts when someone doesn't internalize their frustration, it can consume them.\n\n Its clear she was upset and retained her upset mentality. It made me think of times when I should've let go, instead of holding on to that state of being upset. But I think it's very difficult to realize that.\n\nIt reminded me of when a teammate of mine in high school football messed up a play and fumbled the ball on a punt return. I've never seen him rage this way, he threw his helmet on the floor before getting off the field and yelled like a maniac. The coach immediately scolded him and benched him for that entire game.\n\nI think whether it's a verbal or physical meltdown it's still unprofessional, unsportsmanlike, and a lack of control over emotions from both men or women. Each sport deals with unsportsmanlike conduct their own way, so dont be comparing tennis to hockey.\n\nI think in this incident, it was a meltdown. With a physical aspect coming from racket abuse. And the due to the length of her arguing and saying \"because she's a <b> woman\"</b> (essentially pulling the<b>  sexism</b> card) was part of her verbal meltdown.\n\nSince Serena mentioned th<b> e sexis</b>m it became the main point of this incident, along with the perception of men and women meltdowns.\nIm not denying the existence <b> of sexi</b>sm in the present or past, but this video mentioned that men received more violations than women and the degree of their arguing was different. Also consider the female vs female match and Osaka not experiencing <b> the sex</b>ism Serena felt. This doesn't appear to be a sexist ump tennis issue.\nI also disagree with people stating that \"when it comes to women it's called a meltdown, but with men it's passionate\". On one hand, no one said Tyson ripping off an ear was passionate. Most people if not all agreed, that was a disgrace and disgusting. I think people can find examples of both scenarios. Although I would consider both meltdowns, I understand that Tyson bitting an ear off is on the extreme end of the spectrum. Regardless it was still wrong on Serena and she had a meltdown and the aftermath resulted in Osaka apologizing for her victory. I still must credit Serena acknowledging Osaka's win and not saying that the \"bad reffing\" caused her loss or Osaka's win. Osaka had a momentus victory and as Serena said deserved to win.",

Being super rich through this sport can give a person power and fame but to misuse in this way and try to intimidate the umpire for correctly doing his job by bullying him without success frustrated her as she is used to getting her way.  There are some things even the rich can't do and that is to corrupt certain incorruptible people so as  to allow them to get what they want. Well done Mr.Ramos, you saved women's tennis from people like Williams and others who think shouting and being abusive get them what they need when they are losing.",

Even if just jumping on a band-wagan, You are unaware of the Power of your Wife's.....! Grow up.",

The only reason I'm here is because the media backed her, wasted my time watching news with this frivolous <b> racist </b>and sexist crap. They are the ones pressing<b>  racism</b> an<b> d sexis</b>m. Take those things out of the equation and she's just a bad spor<b> t. Nobo</b>dy would pay attention. \n\nThey do exactly what you are doing now - \"Maybe you just h<b> ate Bl</b>ack people who wi<b> ns\"? No</b>body minded her winning the previous 20 times. She didn't mind, either. Only when she was already down by a set and got a warning did she decide to throw a fit. Then she broke the rules repeatedly. That ref could have penalized her for a game stoppage the first time she appealed. Or the second. Or the third. He didn't. He only did it when she started insulting him.\u00a0 Maybe she knew she was going to lose and just put up a public struggle to win some support. Did that ever occur to you? \n\nAs it was, she was losing even without the penalties. So what's your point? You don't have one even with a generous amount of leniency concerning your English.",

Heard Osaka looks up to Serena to. Is she still a fan after Serena did this? I would not be. Made the crowd turn on her & booing her when she got the award? Serena says \"She stands for women\"? yeah right. She did not do much, to support a half japanese-black young tennis player, who looks up to her. Just stands there in the backround with a smirk on her face when Osaka gets booed. She is a very disgusting person. On the inside she is really nasty.",

They did not rant, threaten, abuse. And they certainly would not go to extreme lengths to justify their misbehaviour afterwards. \nWe also need to bear in mind that top athletes have plenty of psychological preparations & they are well in control of their emotions, that is why they can perform on that level, which implies that it is not just Serena's bad temper what we've seen, but her deliberate display of power.",

            "commentText": "Serena has had an outstanding career and accomplished many things.  But she is also getting on in years.  You can't win against the 20 year olds forever.  The fact that she is still so competitive at her <b> age </b>is a testament to her outstanding athleticism.\n\nBut I don't see how a penalty could have been sexist.  That was out of bounds.  It was a<b>  woman</b>'s game and Osaka is <b> a woma</b>n.  The call perhaps could be construed <b> as raci</b>st perhaps, but with Osaka also being a person of color that would also have been quite a stretch.\n\nCalling some<b> one rac</b>ist or sexist in today's world is one of the deepest insults you can level at them, especially if it isn't true.  It's worse than liar or thief for sure, both of which also seem to be unfounded accusations she leveled at the ref.\n\nThe original call of coaching might not have been necessary but what was the penalty?  1 \"point\"?  I'm not sure exactly what that means but I think it would be equivalent to losing one serve.  It should not have been a big deal.  Then she smashed her racket, which is unprofessional and cost her another point.  But calling the ref a thief, a liar, sexist, and threatening his livelihood was simply over the top.\n\nAnd anyway even without the penalties Osaka probably would have won.  You can't win them all, not even if your name is Serena.\n\nSerena was gracious towards Osaka afterwards though, and that goes a long ways towards me being able to forgive the whole thing as just an outburst due to stress.  She should probably publicly apologize for calling the ref sexist though.",

Veteran players know how important it is to let things go and regain focus.   \n  She has been  built up to be larger than life.   She reminds me of the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland.  No one dares criticize the Queen.  All bow down to the Queen.  LOL.   But a good umpire will follow the rules.   He will NOT bow down.  The constant adoration and butt kissing has hurt Serena.  It would hurt anyone.    And now, she has embarrassed herself and ruined a grand slam final that should have dignity.   The days of McEnroe, Connors, Nastase, etc. are long gone.  Stop comparing today's tennis culture with that of the past.  Serena is playing in the present.",

The verbal abuse was just 1 of the 3 she accumulated. Sure, there were definitely worse verbal abuses in other matches, but those players didn't accumulate 3 violations to get a game penalty.\n\nBesides, now data has revealed that MORE men have been penalized compared to women. \n\nSerena Williams owes Ramos and Naomi a very very public apology",

She couldn't have known that without looking but then also claimed she never looked. Furthermore the signal itself while obvious was not obvious in its meaning. The coach was doing it in the knowledge that his player would see it and understand the meaning. So there's no doubt she's a cheat and, because she then denied having done so in the most strident possible terms, also a liar. That no-coaching rule btw is absurd.

That's proof #1 and also of your stupidity, there is no such country called America, it's a continent and here's where the ugly or arrogant \"American\" part come in, you believe you own the continent or should own it, and tried to, at least the north half in the war of 1812, when we kicked your ass and burnt down your capitol (Canadian if you haven't guessed). Speaking of war, here's a little joke that also explains why the world thinks of you as Ugly \"Americans\". The rest of the world gave shit to the US for joining WW II late and that pissed them of so much that to ever avoid that kind of criticism again, they've started every war since...lol. And finally the latest in a long list of things your country does to make the rest of the world hate you, you elected a <b> racist,</b> sexist,<b>  homophobic</b> bully, who according to John Kerry on Real Time last night (Sept/14/2018) and I along with the rest of the world agree with, has the maturity of an 8 yea<b> r ol</b>d boy with the insecurity of a teenage girl. I could also go on about both your Dem. and Rep. leaders attacking your own troops and people.

I see why you see things the way you do, but Canada and Mexico are not part of the United States. We're still American. We're called the United States or the AMERICAS. United States was the original \"America\". So we're American. If spoken of in a collective sense continentally, Canada, Mexico and United States make up NORTH America. So they are called NORTH Americans. Just as Brazilian and Venezuelan people are Venezuelan and Brazilian separately, but when spoken of collectively combined, they're SOUTH Americans because of the continent.  Just as South Africa is its own seperate country in  Africa, but still part of the <b> African </b>continent. Make sense?",

Tried playing the<b>  gender</b> card saying that this is only happening bc she's <b> a woma</b>n. It was her job to keep track of her penalties. She said that her coach just did a thumbs up and went on a ridiculous clueless rant berating the ump. Then the coach admits he was coaching and the replay showed that the coach was doing a lot more than a thumbs up. Strike 1 and a warning. Then she smashes her racket. 2nd offense and a point is awarded to her opponent. Then she gets all uppity and again starts berating and mouthing off to the ump culminating in calling the ump a thief. The ump had had enough of princess serena's mouthing off and rightly gave her strike 3 for verbal abuse. Game penalty awarded to Naomi. It was serena's job to know that she had 2 strikes and that the 3rd would mean a game penalty but no... she's still all uppity and makin' a jagoff outta herself. She starts blathering about how she's a champion on the court and a champion of issues away from the court. Translation: When she's done with tennis she wants to be some kinda ridiculous left wing mouthpiece, yawnnnnn.... Go fuck yourself you disgrace. You stole the moment from Naomi with your childish tirades where you were WRONG on every aspect and point. Naomi crushed Serena and woulda beat her anyway but jesus christ what an embarrassment. She made a complete spectacle of herself and the ny crowd was terrible and rude. Fuck you Serena, you've tarnished your image for life. No class.",

She is regarded by many as the GOAT but it must be remembered that she is on record as having several outburst on the tennis court in the past and this most recent will be seen in the eyes of many as the most embarrassing. A gracious loser in my mind is ALWAYS a winner. I just wished that she had remained calm after the first warning. The match result could have been different but one has to admit that Naomi played much better than Serena and deserved the title. I'm still a fan of Serena. MAOMI...omg. She has a GREAT tennis career ahead. She's simply beautiful.",

Murray got a penalty for saying \"stupid empiring\" which is far less severe vs Serena calling him a thief and a liar.  \n\nthe thing people need to realize is that Serena didn't just have that one outburst.  She kept bitching continuously.  it wasn't like it was a small one time outburst, it was her constantly harassing the umpire multiple times.  the dude just sat there and took it until she called him a liar and a thief. \n\nthe funny thing is, that shouldn't have even mattered.  the rules in tennis are pretty straight forward.  first penalty warning, second penalty point deduction, third penalty game penalty.  if you already have 2 penalties then you know a 3rd penalty is going to cost you a game.  in this situation why would you even bother continuing to argue with the umpire?  I get it your in the heat of the moment and tempers flare, but when you received the point penalty you yelled at him for a while, he sat there and took it without changing his decision, and play resumed.  why did you feel the need to continue harassing him like he didn't give you 2 penalties already and wasn't going to give you a third.  that just wasn't smart.",

Yes...evolution does play a part as Africa is a harsh place therefore the people must evolved to adapt. She's blessed to have such prowess and wasn't expecting much to her current opponent when she started realizing she was starting to lose and that's when she basically used the \"sexist\" card against the empire. Osaka is half Haitian which is <b> of Afric</b>an decent therefore she also possess some prowess in the field, add that to <b> her </b>age and she really is in her prime.

So then, just WHO is the LIAR, and WHO is the CHEAT ? The umpire, as Serena says ? or SERENA herself ??? It is clear that Serena, and her coach, ALONE are to blame for the disgraceful events caused by Serena\u2018s VILE behaviour. Serena is a great champion, but a very bad loser - I remember a few years ago, when on one of the few occasions when Venus beat her that she cried instead of congratulatng her. Also, the scene where she threatened a line judge that \u201eI swear to God I'll stuff that f*** ball down your f**** throat' also shows the dark side of her personality. The USTA / ITF / WTA need to do something about her ferocious behaviour before somebody gets seriously hurt - instead of trying to find excuses for it, the way Billie Jean King has been doing.",

Out of control behavior has no <b> gender,</b><b>  race</b> o<b> r nationalit</b>y. It happens all the time, but more frequently from some who thinks he or she can get away with it. She was at home, so she felt she was in charge. She played a victim so she could get her supporters to back her up. The lauder them became the more she increased her barrage against a man who was just doing his job. A very good job we must say! Give this real man the $17,000.00 they collected from the abuser. She went home with more than a million. The penalty to be effective it needs to cause a pain in the pocket of the offender. The penalty amount should be a substantial percentage of what they are taking home. That will stop or decrease this abusive manipulation of the game (which is a form of cheating). This behavior is being used by some dishonest players not only in tennis but other sports as well. Humans will push the limits as long as they are allowed to. With all the attention they are getting for doing what is wrong, they won't be motivated to change. Can we honestly blame them for pushing the rules, if they are being allowed to? The decline in our society's morals is creating more opportunities for this barrage to be tolerated, encouraged, excused, and insanely justified. As one general famously said once, 'NUTS'.",

If u think she did all this becoz she is losing, i think you should have watched the match, game penalty came when the score was serena 3-4 osaka and serena was the one to serve and the penalty gave osaka a game lead that means serena lost the opportunity to equal the score on her serve, if penalty is not there, osaka needs to break serena serve to get the match. I am saying all these, because i have seen serena coming back even at the last moments to claim the matches. I am saying all these because i have seen djokovic, murray saying things to umpire but never got any penalty. So i think her point is very clear. BTW i am not american, i am an <b> indian </b>and i support serena not because what she won, because of her oncourt grace. If you don't support serena that's absolutely fine but don't say bullshit things to her, because serena lost the match. Even if she won the match you guys would have told that she distracted osaka with her tantrums and won. Anyhow you guys will not say good things to serena, because you don't like her. You can watch the wimbledon final 2018, australian open final 2016, <b>  indian</b> wells final 2016 when she lost to kerber  and azarenka she acted like a champions by encouraging them. I know there would be lots of negative comments to my comment because you guys are so sick that you want to spread negativity about serena.

That crosses the line and definitely deserves a penalty. Her behaviour is totally deplorable. For her to accuse him of being sexist in the same public venue, on the same night, after making such a disgrace of herself, really shows how unseriously she takes the charge. Apparently she just sees it as another way to get revenge on people she doesn't like, which doesn't speak well for the movement of feminism at all. That all being said, though I don't know much about tennis, penalizing her with a whole game seems pretty steep.",

He was even banned and disqualified from events. Lets also not forget this was many years ago and standards should be higher now.",

Losing her temper after being broken and her racket smash was her undoing. She knows the rules and that a 2nd violation results in loss of a point. ITF Rules, Sec. G: Verbal Abuse:  \"For the purposes of this Rule, verbal abuse is defined as a statement about an official, opponent, sponsor, spectator or other person that implies dishonesty or is derogatory, insulting or otherwise abusive.\" Calling  an official a thief and a liar is derogatory, insulting and impugns the official's objectivity. That is a clear example of verbal abuse. Thus the 3rd code violation. Ramos was doing his job. As you mentioned, Williams had a similar meltdown at the 2009 US Open Final against Kim Clijsters, who champion's ceremony she ruined, also.",

            "commentText": "Its funny to me that everyone is blaming Serena. This is clearly the umpires fault!!!! Serena doesn't receive coaching so she responded like anybody would if they are being called for something they don't do. Although her coach admitted to coaching she had no idea what he was doing so that's why she responded the way she did. Osaka coach was also coaching but of course the umpire didn't see that. I wonder why???? Serena explained to the umpire that she wasn't cheating. She also explained again as she sat in her chair and they both agreed and had a nice conversation. If the umpire was still giving her the violation for coaching he should have made it clear that he was still giving it to her. She thought everything was ok until she slammed her racket and he took a point away. She said it was a warning because she felt the first offense for coaching had been handled. Had she known she still had a violation for coaching she would have never slammed her racket, that's why she told the umpire slamming the racket was a warning. This is also why she responded the way she did. And to make matters worse he took a whole game from her because she called him a thief. Taking that game away from her was totally uncalled for. She wasn't saying anything bad enough to have a game taken away from her. Most people would have had the same reaction as her. I love Naomi and she played an incredible match and probably would have won anyway but that's besides the point. Another player should not be cheated rather they are winning or losing. Naomi was serving at 4-3 in the second set and if Serena would have broken her on that game it could have changed the whole match but Serena was not given the opportunity to fight. Once again, I am very happy for Osaka and she played amazing but the UMPIRE is to blame not Serena.",

To outsiders, we must look so incredibly dysfunctional if our Grand-Slam tournament can look as shambolic as it did by the hands of one single player. The essence of this sport, \"Sportsmanship\" died a miserable death on American soil by the hands of an American. Didn't anybody tell Serena \"not to shit on your own door step\"? Pity Mouratoglu didn't learn how to hand signal that message. He would have saved us and poor Naomi much anguish. It has taken Serena decades of hard work, tenacity and professionalism to build her reputation. Is it worth losing it all in <b> Crazy </b>moments like this? She will reflect upon this episode with regret I'm sure for years to come but will need to look long and hard at elements in her team and their destructive nature. No 24th GS is worth winning at this kind of cost.",

Sorry but the last time I checked the solution to one party breaking the rules and getting away with it and one party breaking the rules and not to go the opposite direction and throw the rules out all together but to properly enforce them for all parties. Not to mention she was trying to use her start power and name to intimidate the umpire. How would that have been fair for a newcomer like Naomi Osaka. Finally this is a match between two women, both of their behavior was subject to the same criticism. She claims she lost it because she called him a thief but she also threatened him and called him a liar, he let a lot of things she said slide before he finally gave her that third penalty. I honestly think in this match as least her behavior was despicable and it is a real shame because this match was also a dream for Naomi Osaka who had the joy of achieving something so momentous ripped away from her.",

How ever, she started this episode or theater first to break her opponent's rhythm = very unsportive and unfair. Then she lost temper and went against the chairman because he did NOT let himself intimidate, what is the general purpose of the \"Williams show\";  to intimidate people incl. the opponent on the other side of the net! I hope in future in every Williams match there are people enough who have a eye on her coaching staff around the court! (it is NOT just 1 person!).",

She tried to take young impressionable Osaka out of her zone and turn the momentum back her way.  Didn't work. She smashes her racquet to where it was unplayable-Romas should have made her finish the match using it instead of giving Diva girl a point penalty.  She doesn't argue that the point was taken away from her because she smashed her racquet she argues because she was accused of cheating, which DID happen.  So, she gets busted and just like a spoiled child, argues.  Then loses an important game and smashes her racquet.  Gets penalized and acts like she didn't ever do it.  Then argues immediately back to the accusation of cheating.  She continues with this over and over and over and over and over and over again.  Damn self proclaimed diva girl-give it up!!!  FINALLY!  YES-FINALLY, the official penalizes her for her abuse...which is a rule, remember, Ramos was hired and is seasoned and respected, to enforce the rules of the game and the tournament.  She blames her loss on HIM.  Takes Osaka's \"moment\" from her and continues with badgering HIM.  Who the hell is a flipping sexist?  Not Ramos!!!!  Can we just be done with Serena.  She is a great athlete but she has brought trash into the sport.  What is that saying, you can take the girl out of the ghetto but you can't take the ghetto out of the girl?  Something like that.  To diva girl-for your daughter's sake, retire and take care of her.  You are doing a disservice to her and all women with your continued behavior.  I don't want you speaking for me and my daughters.",

Look at female tennis players getting the same prize money as men for working fewer hours. Last year a male Italian player got a far worse fine than Williams for his own misconduct with a suspended grand slam ban hanging over him after it. In 1990 john McEnroe was disqualified from the Australian open for his own misconduct. At the us open far more code violations were given against men than women. Williams was not fighting for all women everywhere when she threatened a female line judge before her disqualification against Kim clijsters there in 2009. She should have got her focus back after the first code violation and used her own experience to get back in the match against an inexperienced opponent. Instead she lost her discipline destroying any chance of a comeback. You cannot do that in any sport. Naomi Osaka deserved her victory and the way the presenters and the crowd treated her was a disgrace. In mitigation Williams did not take any of her anger out on Osaka but the poor atmosphere she stoked led to this.",

You are one of those people who eagerly wait for Serena to snap.\nwhich is worse: lighting the fire or pouring gasoline on an already burning fire?\nCarlos knew that Serena was already tensed trying to crawl back after losing the first set. Only a foolish umpire with a mission to cause trouble would have looked into Serena's box at that time to see \"coaching\". You are trying to make Serena a liar but the answer she gave as well as that of her coach are not mutually exclusive. Patrick being the coach tried to give some hand signal which Serena says she didn't pick up as coaching. I have watched Tennis all my life and players tend to look at their box especially when they are in trouble. Ramos has no business trying to interpret the intentions of that hand signal at a time when the greatest female athlete in history was trying to make it out of trouble.\nHi dude, Serena did not win #23 grand slams via hand coaching. Which is one reason she was angry because Ramos basically placed her in the same bucket with known cheaters and thieves like Maria Sharapova?\nSerena would rather lose than be called a cheater which is why she kept fighting. Please keep to politics. Leave our sissey alone.Keep to your chinese politics.",

Williams was also fined $3,000 for breaking her racket and $4,000 for being warned for coaching. The money will be docked from her runner-up prize of $1.85 million.\n\n\nUnder Article III, Section P of the Grand Slam Rule Book, 'verbal abuse' is defined as 'a statement about an official, opponent, sponsor, spectator or other person that implies dishonesty or is derogatory, insulting or otherwise abusive.' The section says a player is subject to a fine up to $20,000 for each violation.\n\nThere are separate categories for coaching ('Communications of any kind, audible or visible, between a player and a coach may be construed as coaching') and for abuse of rackets or equipment.",

            "commentText": "Making this about '<b> sexism'</b> was a big mistake on Williams' part. Although it seems more likely from the evidence that she was being coached, there is still a large grey area with regard to that. It's entirely possible that the coach did it on his own, and she didn't use it, instead, realizing how it could be misconstrued, she openly admitted what the coach was doing. On the other hand, she may have been lying to cover it up. Who knows. What is justified is the second penalty. If implying 'dishonesty' about an 'official' is classified as verbal abuse, then she certainly did violate that one. Perhaps she was being treated unfairly at first, but not because of<b>  sexism</b>. She just had a disagreement with the official on a judgement call, which happens all the time in sports, but instead of quietly and begrudgingly accepting the decision, she made a big scene and retaliated verbally. That is on her, not the official. \n\nMaking this abou<b> t sexis</b>m after the fact removes any sympathy I may have had for her. If instead she owed up to the facts and tried to be as accepting of the possibility of how she may be wrong, and then defended her actions, that would look a lot better on her part. Instead, she's being childish and just accusing the person she disagrees with of being a bad person (sexist). That's how a child responds to speech they don't like. Rather than respectfully disagreeing, they call each other names.",

Instead of becoming the greatest female tennis ever, she has, by her own doing, set a good example of how to become one of the world's ugliest.  Without a doubt, she is her own worst enemy.  Naomi Osaka must be deeply disappointed with her childhood hero's self-inflicted ignominious fall from grace. I look forward to this young and enormously talented tennis rising star climbing to the penacle of the sport and earning her place as \"The Greatest\", something that Serena could never be.",

Demanding an apology from Ramos is <b> nothing </b>short of bullying. \n\nRamos did a fine job and Serena should be suspended for next years USO.\n\nIt is Serena that owes Ramos the apology.",

I don't know if calling the umpire a thief was what tipped it over the edge for him, but after she started threatening the umpire with \"you will never work on the same court as me again\", I really wasn't surprised she got the code violation.\n\nThe point penalty for racket abuse was correct. If you totally break your racket it pretty much always gets you a code violation, for both men and women. If you slam your racket and don't \"break\" it, they'll usually let those slide. So that's why sometimes players slam their racket and then keep playing with it for another couple of points.\n\nAnd breaking your racket isn't very unusual. But normally players never break their racket after already having 1 code violation because <b> nobody </b>wants a point penalty.\n\nWhen Serena slammed her racket, she 100% knew that she was going to get a point penalty (being the 2nd code violation). Then she wanted the umpire to go back and remove the 1st code violation so she wouldn't get the point penalty. That literally never happens in tennis. She knew this. It's not really fair of her to<b>  freak</b> out about that.\n\nSo her getting that point penalty ha<b> d nothin</b>g to do wi<b> th sexi</b>sm. She got that penalty because just lost a game that made it look like she would lose the match and she was pissed.\n\nAlso, I don't think she should come out looking positive because she tried to salvage the ceremony that she ruined by creating a huge drama right before she was about to lose.",

So it's absolutely okay to look at your box for support. What she saw, was a double thumbs up from her coach. I trust champions like Serena to absolutely admit if she thought the coach was coaching, instead of a thumbs up. Like she said...we athletes would rather lose than cheat. I stand by her. Until the day she admits she saw it as coaching. That day she and me will owe you an apology. I pray, for the sake of the millions of girls and boys inspired by Serena, that day never comes.

She was fully capable of communicating with her coach, whether she actually saw it or not is irrelevant. It was a clear cut violation. The ump did what he supposed to do and gave her (and her coach) a warning. They r not even arguing about that. Are u sure u r a tennis coach? \n\n\"It is not irrelevant if she saw it or not.

The thief violation on the other hand is an arbitrary call on Ramos part. It's a bit harsh imo. He is indeed known to be one of the strictest umps out there and has penalized players for rather benign verbal abuse.",

            "commentText": "It is unfortunate to see such behavior from Serena. This behavior only makes her look as a very bad loser, very weak person, with this episode the respect of her fans and people in general had for her is jeopardized and it will change. The rules apply to everyone, including Serena Williams. The fact that she can't accept that these rules are to be respected is something that she totally disregarded, I though she knew better. It is clear that coaching is not allowed in Gran Slams, period!!! Even Chris Evert while broadcasting this match, said that Serena was watching her coach when he was sending signals to Serena to move to the net. Besides that it doesn't matter if Serena saw the coach coaching her, if the coach is coaching even if the player doesn't see him/her, this is going to get the player a penalty.Who does she think she is? I think Serena is the one with double standard rather than the empire. If she portraits herself as a super champion, an advocate for equality, etc. etc. why can she not back all this up with fairness and intelligence? Why does she expect to be treated differently than any other player, male or female and hide herself in all kind of ridiculous causes that some of them don't merit to even be mentioned because they simply don't make any sense. She is simply an arrogant and weak person trying to convince the world differently. I am a mother of a daughter and son and it was pathetic and embarrassing to see her behavior. Not a role model at all or someone to admire regardless of of her victories, Serena is simply someone too hungry for another Grand Slam and she couldn't bear the possibility that she was going to lose and she took it up on the umpire. Who is the unfair person here, Serena or the Umpire? The rules are there to be applied. I feel sorry for the umpire who is told to apply the rules, but specially the WTA and ATP are backing up Serena, tennis fans are also very disappointed at these organizations for not keeping the sport with high moral standards and double standards like in this situation, they need to put it this together ASAP before they lose more credibility. In a nutshell, it is all about Serena. She didn't think for a minute that she was ruining the entire match, this includes, the real Champion Naomi Osaka, all the spectators, all the fans in the entire world, the tennis world, the young tennis players to name some,I find this absolutely irresponsible and acceptable. Then she tried to console Naomi during the ceremony which is a joke. Serena has received so much credit for this in circumstances that Serena created this horrific situation, but so many <b> blind </b>people are out there that can't see this clear because a lot of them don't know anything about the rules in Grand Slams or they just can't think objectively and without emotions.\nSerena, this is for you, it is time to retire, there are new gracious champions coming, i.e. Naomi Osaka!!!

She was WTA number 1 for 10 long years and she did not bore everyone to death standing on the baseline. What more do you need to prove her quality and if that wasn't enough she retired at 30. If Steffi Graf had carried on until she was 36 no one would have touched that record but she retired early. These are the reasons she is not only special but the greatest female tennis player of all time.",

Having said that Serena has lost plenty of matches and never had this reaction so if the umpire did something afoul or seemingly to Serena it appeared so she has the right to address it.  Naomi moment shouldn't be overshadowed by that but she was right men have done and said much worse and weren't given the penalty she was and that's not to say she didn't deserve a couple of those penalties.  Lord I hope people with reading comprehension skills get this before they want to comment on my post.  Cheater no Serena is not sore loser not she is not but who really likes to lose tho she handled that loss with grace and still showed the utmost respect for Naomi Osaka at the trophy ceremony and shut the crowd down who tried to boo.  Much love to Serena Williams the GOAT in women's tennis and a big congratulations to Naomi Osaka on her 1st Grand Slam championship",

She typically loses her cool when she is losing to someone she felt she would beat easily.  I once liked watching Serena Williams play.  But her temper tantrums, especially when she is losing.  Being a Champion is not just about being the best player.  Being a champion is carrying yourself as such.  Knowing you have young children who look up to you.  Those children see these outburst of temper tantrums.  To a young mind.  They begin to think this is the way they too are supposed to act when they lose or if the parents ground them for bad grades.  True Champions take the wins and losses as they come.  They know their stats in their sport and they carry themselves with pride, dignity and self respect regardless of the situation. There are many great champions of all types of sports who carried themselves like a true champion.  Those are the real champions.",

Serena has been the GOAT of <b> woman </b>tennis for very long time.. i think she never prepared to actualy accept losing in a big margin. The world should also focusing a new champ from japan rather than keep discussing the ref's desicion and the match controversy",

He then received a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct after yelling.\n\n\u2013 In 2018 at Wimbledon, Ramos gave Djokovic a code violation for slamming his racquet into the ground. Djokovic later complained about a double standard from Ramos, who did not penalize Kei Nishikori for something similar.\n\n\u2013 In 2017 at the French Open, Ramos called a time violation on Rafael Nadal. Nadal thought the call was selectively enforced and said he was not satisfied with it.\n\n\u2013 In 2016 at the French Open, Ramos called Nick Kyrgios for a code violation for yelling at a towel boy. Kyrgios accused Ramos of having a double standard and was described as 'mystified' by the penalty.\n\n\u2013 In August 2016 at the Olympics, Ramos called Andy Murray for a code violation for saying 'stupid umpiring.'\n\n\u2013 In July 2017, Ramos called Andy Murray for a time violation for playing too slowly. Murray acknowledged he had been warned before receiving the violation but was still bothered by it.\n\n<b> Sexism </b>intensifies.",

This actually makes sense, as men must win 5 sets of each match vs a mere 2 sets for the women. So there's little incentive to getting angry, as you'll make it up in later sets.\n\nIs there a difference between Serena Williams and other female tennis players? Yes. Serena flips her shit over and over. Every other female player, even her sister, gets way less penalties than Serena does. She's an adult child who can't control herself.",

It's especially true when we hear of <b> sexism,</b><b>  racism</b> or rape violations. These are extremely serious issues and we should tread lightly when accusing people of these things. Here in Australia, you can go to jail for discrimination and can get up to 3 years in prison for insulting someone based o<b> n rac</b>e and of course you can get years and years in prison where you'll be beaten daily if you have a rape conviction. What I am saying is, no we obviously shouldn't blame the apparent victim but we should be listening to both sides of the story and sympathizing and empathizing with both parties. If we don't, it'll end up like White Australia <b> or Jim <b> Cr</b</b>>ow america where<b>  one w</b>oman has the power to have a man lynched for looking at her wrong.",

Football gets ugly very quickly it's changed alot in the last 5 or so years but it's still not stricked enough for me. \nOfficials right or wrong must be allowed to do their job and be given respect. You cannot call into question an officials integrity during a game based on officiating according to the rules. Their are standards and avenues you can follow if you feel their has been unfair play and it can be reviewed and that official can lose their job.\nWhat Serena did was ugly and unsprotsman like, so fan of tennis wants to see that they want to watch tennis only people who don't really care about tennis but love drama and controversy are supporting Serena here.",

Out of control behavior has no <b> gender,</b><b>  race</b><b> , nationalit</b>y or excuses. It happens all the time, but more frequently from some who thinks he or she can get away with it. She was at home, so she felt she was in charge. She played a victim so she could get her supporters to back her up. The lauder them became the more she increased her barrage against a man who was just doing his job. A very good job we must say! Give this real man the $17,000.00 they collected from the abuser. She went home with more than a million. The penalty to be effective it needs to cause a pain in the pocket of the offender. The penalty amount should be a substantial percentage of what they are taking home. That will stop or decrease this abusive manipulation of the game (which as a form of cheating). This behavior is being used by some dishonest players not only in tennis but other sports as well. Humans will push the limits as long as they are allowed to. With all the attention they are getting for doing what is wrong, they won't be motivated to change. Can we honestly blame them for pushing the rules, if they are being allowed to? The decline in our society's morals is creating more opportunities for this barrage to be tolerated, encouraged, excused, and insanely justified. As one general famously said once, 'NUTS'.",

The thing is that they had out bursts, yet they were warned once, and then they STOPPED!!! She was warned repeatedly and was given a chance to cool down, however she doubled down and continued, so that's the reason. She was DEFINITELY CHEATING, her coach even admitted to it so that's why she was docked. Yes, there was 100% <b> sexism </b>taken place, yet again it was on Serena's behalf. Basically she was acting like a child, cheating, being reckless by breaking her racket, lied, and continued to break the rules by abusing the umpire! She's the one who owes Carlos an  apology, along with Miss Osaka. She ruined Miss Osaka's first Grand Slam.",

He obliged. Then she passive-aggressively yelled at him once more, time was called, she had something to eat something to drink, grabbed her things and engaged him one more time calling him a thief. He awarded the penalty when in his mind it became clear that Serena didn't intend to let it go. mauricio virmond",

Do you understand the game or are you one of those non fans that really doesn't have a clue how the game of tennis works nor what the rules are there for. Not everybody is a tennis fan.

Remember the moment 2009 when she threatened that line umpire (that was a<b>  woman</b>). She decided that Serena broke the rule and warned her (by the book), but when Serena threatened her she got scared. In opposition, I repeat, Mr Ramos wasn't scared or intimidated in that moments.

It is a story of a sore loser and someone that clearly doesn't know when to STFU.\n\nAll professional athletes know that a referee/umpire decision is never rescinded during a game, as it would undermine the authority of the referee/umpire. The correct way to deal with what you may feel is an unjust penalty is to follow the official appeals procedure laid out in the rules of your game.\n\nTake your first penalty on the chin, brush it off and carry on like a professional. Then appeal after the match if it means that much to you.\n\nIt is extremely offensive and disrespectful of Serena Williams to clai<b> m sexis</b>m for this case, due to the fact that she truly did break the rules and received fair and just penalties according to the rules she agreed to play by.\n\nBy claimi<b> ng sexi</b>sm, she is trivialising r<b> eal sex</b>ism<b>  and ge</b>nder inequality in the world and playing down all the experiences of women who have to deal with<b>  REAL s</b>exism on a daily basi<b> s.\n\nNo</b> woman should be standing up for Serena's behaviour, it was unacceptable and play<b> ing the</b> gender card simply took her petulance to the next level.\n\nYou broke the rul<b> es, no</b>w \"woman\" up and take your medicine.",

You are a Thief - You owe me an apology - you'll never chair when I am on court, never again till I am alive - year - All with the index finger pointed straight at the face of the referee which for me is the worse of all - after all breaking the racket on the ground. . . and when she have seen that all this did't work tried with tears, with \"I am a mother \" and more and more down in level - <b> sexism </b>- - -Pathetic excuse. - Still defending Serena? Of course you are free and you can but, honestly you do not have much ground. Maybe the Business system will try to bail her out somehow but, to me, Serena is a great player but a very poor loser\nShow less\n\n\nREPLY",

Sore loser, some believe. Not controlling her emotions under pressure, absolutely. Who hasn't? She'll either pull herself together or retire, either way doesn't matter to me but I hope she pulls it together for at least one more grand slam win. Naomi was robbed of her moment and I felt sorry for her. Would Serena have turned the match around if she had not been penalized, we'll never know but Naomi did outplay her.",

Tennis is the only sport to rival golf in terms of 'clawing-at-my-eyes-I'm-so-bored-please-Jesus-God-almighty-make-is-stop-please-God-please' boringness. But what she said at 2:36 was waaay out of line. She threatened his career because she didn't agree with his, uh, referee-ing(?). That's grounds for ejection from the tournament imo. Was the referee sexist, though? Fuck if I know.\n\nOne thing that irks me about the whole controversy is this cartoon of her drawn in this antiquated style of <b> racist </b>caricature drawing where it looks like the artist tried really hard to make her look aboriginal/tribal. Seeing a lot of apologetics surrounding it. I'm usually pretty quick to defend those being called<b>  racist</b>, but not this time. I've seen that style enough to know what it represents. My favorite comment around it is (paraphrased) 'once I saw this cartoon, I knew the leftists would call i<b> t racis</b>t.' This person recognizes the signs and is still in denial smh. Some people literally require somebody to say 'I'm<b>  a raci</b>st, no joke' before admitting the person<b>  is rac</b>ist.",

I lived in Asia for years and found 'China Uncensored ' so refreshing, but after leaving and moving to Europe I ran across this channel and it has become painfully clear that Chris and his supporters are less seekers of truth, but more bent on painting white america as superior and ANY people (be they <b> Black,</b> Latino or Asian) who threatens this image of themselves will be attacked and mocked on his channels. Predictable and pathetic. \n\nHaha\u2014just scrolled down to see a few comments, and boy was I right!",

This was a drama queen, intent on painting herself a victim in an attempt to save face. Any defense of this on court bully with an extensive history as such, is pathetic. Serena knows the rules, and the rules were applied fairly. In no other sport would the application of penalties be brought into question, you break those rules, you're penalized accordingly. Fact is, it had no effect on the outcome of the match, she was already dead in the water. The chair actually showed far more patience than he was obligated to by the rules of the game. Serena was to be the loser, and by her own actions, she's just a bigger one now. She was a disgrace! For that matter, so are all of the people defending the indefensible. This is the same Serena who once told a FEMALE line judge, \"If I could, I would cram this f-ing ball down your f-ing throat!\" Way to fight for women's rights!!! If a man said that to a female line judge, it would most probably end his career, or at least put a dark cloud over him forever. She's an egocentric, spoiled <b> brat,</b> with a total lack of accountability. In my opinion, this day defines, not only her career, but shows us all what the real Serena is like. She may be a tennis great, but she's a detestable human being.",

What gets me about this whole part of Serena Williams' argument is that she was telling the Referee: 'I understand the rules.'  \n\nI did not at the time know this whole 'Code Violations penalty hierarchy' rule. But I don't play tennis. Williams said: 'I understand the rules.' And she complained that 'Men have said worse things' and not been penalized a game. \n\nUnfortunately, even recently retired male Tennis professional player, Andy Roddick, fell for it. Stating Williams was correct (using himself as an example). \n\nShe is correct. That, I believe has never happened to a man. Also, if I am correct, Serena Williams is the FIRST professional tennis player (Female OR Male) to be assessed a game penalty for verbally abusing an umpire. \n\nThat is only because it was her THIRD OFFENSE!\n\nFor someone who literally says to the referee: 'I understand the rules.'; it is clear that she DOES NOT !!  Otherwise, she never would have complained for almost 10 minutes afterwards.",

Researchers have documented several cases of violent, aggressive behavior associated with anabolic-androgenic steroid use, even athletes with no prior history of violence (according to a paper published in 2010 in the journal Hormones and Behavior). Check out Serena's workout schedule - Jazzercise and running won't produce that body. Serena Williams is often called not just the greatest female athlete but also the greatest athlete period (what a joke). They said the very same thing about Marion Jones who finally admitted to doping. When Serena's coach admitted to cheating because \"everyone does it,\" it sounded a lot like drug use - when you consider the people most likely to have an ADD diagnosis are Olympic athletes (so they can take uppers). Sharapova was caught. <b> Nobody </b>questioned whether Joyner was roided - just too much muscle in too short a time. Cox and White were caught. Thomas's facial hair was too obvious. It's not just the Russians. The other issue is once you start lying, becoming pathological is the natural end result. The claim men have done the same is not accurate. They're rages were short - they were all able to get control of themselves. It was so sad that beating her had to come with an apology from her opponent - not fair. Repeatedly, Trevor claims we should allow athletes whatever is<b>  common</b> but then he chokes down almost saying \"drugs.\" Google NFL \"excessive rage.\" Trevor lies. The issue for many is their only source of news is comedians pandering to their biases. Serena did not get the penalty for her childishly slamming her racket but for her non-stop verbal abuse. Sounds like every person to get a speeding ticket like ever - why didn't everyone get one? It was not \"amazing,\" only disgusting and juvenile. Serena has illegally threatened refs before.\n\n [LINK]  => Trevor's take on it.",

STEROIDS.\"\n\nThere have been all kind of rumors circulating around men in many sports over the years and even on rare occasions a few women (like Joyner)... why never Queen Serena? Doesn't her completely closed workouts further raise suspicion? We readily accept that men behave poorly but we refuse to suggest that women might ever be held accountable. Serena admits to seeing her coach but pretends she didn't understand the obvious sign to play closer to the net saying it was a \"thumbs up\" BUT then later lied saying she never saw him. People are saying the ref was incompetent (he wasn't) for going overboard when she called him a \"thief\" - it was for failing to ever stop her silly tantrum. Trevor's suggesting the problem was destroying her racket is a bold faced lie. He was there - he knows. At no time was she able to control herself like an adult. She uses the victim troupe women have been using forever. I'm a <b> woman,</b> I have a child, won't you rescue me? One might suggest it's unfair to blame Serena since girls are raised to be drama queens. There is<b>  nothing</b> more pathetic than when Naomi Osaka was forced to apologize for beating Queen Serena. Shame on the mob for not allowing her to have her moment of glory. :-(\n\nAnd again, just look at rea<b> l woma</b>n Naomi Osaka's body. My mother got a physics degree from Duke with my dad (and got better grades) and was easily able to get a better paying job than he even in the late 1940s. However, they couldn't afford to buy a home so my 5'2 mom volunteered to build it herself (eventually winning the Delco Home award in 1965). She could easily carry four cinder blocks at a time while my 6'4\" Navy Commander dad gave himself a hernia trying to carry one. Mom ended working in construction for the next decade. I once saw two larger youths attempt to rob her - she had them both on the ground in seconds. Her body didn't look anything like Serena's. Get real. You are the first person to affirm such an opinion makes sense - I don't get why. I honestly believe women could compete with men in sports. There's no doubt mom could have taken my dad. Bruce Lee proved size doesn't matter. Women just aren't willing to make the same effort. Listen to the other female tennis players talking about how lifting weights would be too much effort... like the male tennis players do. It's the same with surgeons - there's <b> no sexi</b>sm just women raised with a more \"healthy\" life / work balance. And oh, studies confirm that just like the guy who claims to do \"it\" the most usually doesn't at all (and doesn't even like it), those who scream \"I never cheat\" the loudest are cheating the most often. The Freakonomics statisticians showed the most corrupt people are those never held accountable, and by profession K-12 teachers are most likely to lie, cheat, and steal.",

Out of control behavior has no <b> gender,</b><b>  race</b> o<b> r nationalit</b>y. It happens all the time, but more frequently from some who thinks he or she can get away with it. She was at home, so she felt she was in charge. She played a victim so she could get her supporters to back her up. The lauder them became the more she increased her barrage against a man who was just doing his job. A very good job we must say! Give this real man the $17,000.00 they collected from the abuser. She went home with more than a million. The penalty to be effective it needs to cause a pain in the pocket of the offender. The penalty amount should be a substantial percentage of what they are taking home. That will stop or decrease this abusive manipulation of the game (which as a form of cheating). This behavior is being used by some dishonest players not only in tennis but other sports as well. Humans will push the limits as long as they are allowed to. With all the attention they are getting for doing what is wrong, they won't be motivated to change. Can we honestly blame them for pushing the rules, if they are being allowed to? The decline in our society's morals is creating more opportunities for this barrage to be tolerated, encouraged, excused, and insanely justified. As one general famously said once, 'NUTS'.",

The Coach, Umpire and Serena. I think she just lost her cool thinking that she was being accused of cheating. Which for her status and all those that look up to her is a very big and important thing. If the Coach didn't coach and if the Umpire would have communicated better about not accusing her but her coach, as well as Serena just letting it go. I think that would have been a good outcome. As to her having a anger issue, I don't know if I agree. You showed a couple examples, but if that was true it would be more prevalent wouldn't it? She lost plenty of games to have more than a couple rises. In the end you are right, Naomi Osaka spotlight was really shadowed over the incident and I do think it was great of Serena to try and let everyone know that this is supposed to be a great moment for Osaka. Speaking of Osaka she is a Japanese Haitian. I believe she said that it is important to her, to let people know she is also Hattian. Also, good episode as always.",

Everyone must be held to the same standards and follow the same rules, or the standards and the rule are completely worthless. You see how social justice is always being exploited for a person's personal benefit? Notice how it's being exploited by corporations to turn a profit? Social justice has become cheap and superficial, and that's why society is doing the exact opposite of becoming a better place for everyone. Guess who's greatly enjoying the social instability and cultural degeneracy of the West? China and Russia. We make it way too easy for them to manipulate us. I've a friend who experimented with it, and it's really not hard to get an internet mob of hundreds to attack an individual or group for absolutely no reason at all. Their greatest achievement in the game of social engineering was to persuade a <b> black </b>rights Facebook group that the Jews were really behind the Atlantic Slave Trade and everything that followed. By now a few of them have probably adopted extremist ideologies and have become fervent anti-Semites. Ez Pz. Social justice has become a kind of market, and it's also become a kind of social credit. The more zealously a person promotes it, the better their personal image. Authenticity and sincerity not required.",

Thank you so much for highlighting how a large amount of women use the notion of <b> sexism </b>as a scape goat to hide their own poor behavior, poor performance, poor attitude, sense of entitlement, and overall shortcomings. Using<b>  sexism</b> as a means of escaping responsibiliy for your piss poor actions, attitude, and judgment is a shinning example for all women of what a strong and independen<b> t woma</b>n is. Your a proud and strong role model for any looking to escape personal responsibility. \n\nI'm glad you lost, in your head and in your heart Serena you know you behaved like a spoiled obnoxious child. I know you know, and I know you know that most people know. I hope you feel that deep shame when people look at you.",

In this case, imho she felt entitled to another win, one that would break a record.  When she saw it slipping out of her hands and on to the next generation of female tennis star, she grasped at whatever she could to explain away her losing.  \n\nWhat a childish, arrogant \"example\" to give while playing someone who idolized her.  I hope Naomi Osaka goes on to beat all of William's records, while being a better sport all the while.",

Serena was out there for the money.  \n\nSerena didn't just have a baby because MTFs cannot have children you have to have a uterus and ovaries to have a baby.  The baby was either adopted or is a surrogate courtesy of her husband's sperm.  \n\nMTFs (and WTM) do not <b> age </b>well.  Serena is 36 and the estrogen isn't working any longer.  So each year Serena (and Venus) are reverting back into the males that they were when they were born.  Unfortunately, they've had so much plastic surgery done with breast and buttocks and who knows what else, that this will not end very pretty.  Can't you tell by looking at Serena's huge skull?  Her skull didn't look like that when she was a teenager.  Look at the eyebrow ridge, the slanted forehead and jaw line. Women do not have the kind of arm and leg massive skeletal muscle structure that Serena has.  Can you think of any other<b>  woman</b> tennis player that was that huge?  Hell, she's bigger than most of the men! \n\nSerena is really pissed that the gig is up.  I'd be pissed too.  Serena and Venus never had a choice in the matter.  Their father into the worship of the baphomet and he sacrificed both his two sons for wealth.  He said as much in a magazine.  He wanted out of Compton but was poor.  So he sacrificed Serena and Venus to the baphomet. They were given estrogen from a very youn<b> g ag</b>e (Just like Shiloh Pitt is being sacrificed.)  Serena and Venus were castrated before puberty and their penis was made into a \"vagina.\"  Their father is a bastard and should be put in prison.  \n\nI'm sure Serena was very jealous of the beautiful you<b> ng wom</b>an, Naomi Osaka she/he played against and that might actually be the reason Serena played so poorly.  Naomi is at the beginning of her career and Serena is at the twilight of hers/his.  \n\nHell, even the referee got to live a more authentic life than Serena and Venus.  How sad is that?",

Look at the shape of her head since she was in her early 20's (not hair, just eyebrow ridge, forehead <b> slant </b>and jawline).  She is more muscular than most men.  Frankly, I don't care how she/he chooses to live but it is not an honest competition for a MTF to play against a female.  And since this is our new reality, it needs to be addressed.",

In fact, it is sexist for you to think that only a man can develop muscles like hers. Also, I don't see anything wrong with her jawline. Other women have more defined jawlines than hers. I mean, the post with Beyonc\u00e9 makes me think they're sisters. So please, just stop with the nonsensical claims. People always fall into the traps set up by the media",

What that really says is that they never reached the third code violation to trigger a game penalty.  They knew not to get another violation.  And for Serena to tell the umpires who came out on the court that men say much worse things and never get penalized is a bit ingenious.  And when she was penalized for threatening a lines person a few years ago at the Open she again pointed out that other people had said worse without penalty.  So she's used this argument many times before.  Believe me, there is discrimination in tennis.  If anyone other than Serena had behaved like this, she would have been suspended.  Not is my wildest dreams could I even imagine Osaka behaving like this.",

They are punished MORE than women, if you look at how many code violations are dished out to men as opposed to women at any grand slam in history.\nJust look at John Macenroe back in the 80's, and in 1990. He was disqualified for being just as bad as Serena.\nBut you're right in how the violations are dished out. Warning, point, game. She kept pushing it, and as soon as you start insulting the umpire, calling him a thief and a liar, demanding an apology, she was guilty of another infraction. The umpire had no alternative.\nHer pulling the mother card and the <b> woman </b>card is just telling of how angry she was at losing to a virtual unknown, especially one that was a minority, so she couldn't pull the<b>  race</b> card.",

These associations are made up of ex-players, founders, and owners of the clubs where tennis is taught and played. If they aren't the appropriate people to come up with rules, then I don't know who is.\nAnd of COURSE they aren't allowed to go breaking property, their own or otherwise. Act appropriately.\nAnd it's not that coaches can't coach. In a grand slam, they aren't allowed to coach during the game. In other championships they can, but not in grand slams, they are the pinnacle of the sport and rely on certain sets of rules. These rules have been in place since day one for the most part, and every player who plays knows the rules and agree's to abide by them.\nThey don't have to agree, they can refuse to take part in grand slams if they don't like it. But Serena has been at the very top of this sport for over 15 years, she knows the rules.\nAs you say, you don't like the sport anyway. Good for you. You're obviously just a SJW <b> feminazi </b>demanding everyone change the rules of a sport you know fuck all about. That is fascistic, don't you think?\nAnd regardless of whether she agreed with the umpire decision, claiming feminism and claiming \"I'm a MOTHER\" is just fucking ridiculous, and this is why people hate her. She had absolutely no right to claim it was because she was a<b>  woman</b>, and claiming thi<b> s ol</b>d \"I have a daughter\" line is really fucki<b> ng o</b>ld now.
