I do feel uncomfortable ringing up my bank. It has happened three or four times and it is ridiculous.\u2019', 'She now has to bring her ID to the central Nottingham branch, which is about six miles from her home in the village of Strelley.', 'Miss Westerleigh added: \u2018It gets to the point where I have told them several times \u2018I am transgender. It is in my file. I should not have to keep saying it.\u2019', 'She accused the bank of \u2018not taking the trans community seriously\u2019.', 'Formerly known as Kurtis, Miss Westerleigh, says she felt uncomfortable living as a man for some time and her friends and family have been supportive of her transition.', 'Miss Westerleigh, whose name was inspired by American TV host Ellen Degeneres, is currently awaiting hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery.', 'HSBC says it is reviewing Miss Westerleigh\u2019s complaint and have introduced recent changes to their system and training to support transgender customers.', 'A spokesman for the bank said: \u2018We are very sorry for the disappointing level of service experienced by Miss Westerleigh, and are committed to learning from this to help ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.', '\u2018We are a proud and active supporter of customers and colleagues across the broad spectrum of diversity of sexuality and gender identity.\u2019",

Now think about this you are willing to accept that this person is a <b> woman </b>trapped in a mans body. And that means you accept that he knows exactly what it feels to be a<b>  woman</b>. Yet he hasn't and will never have a period. Or go through his time of the month. But you still believe he knows what it is to be female. He will not be able to have a baby. He will never have a smear test. He will never go through the menopause. He will never experienc<b> e sexis</b>m. Yet you <b> as wom</b>an will totally contradict what we as men are told we could never understand,by women. Because he takes a label and decides to identify a<b> s a wo</b>man. And suddenly, yes he is just like you he knows exactly what you have experienced and gone through <b> as a w</b>oman.and he can totally relate to you. So if you want to stand by your opinion. None of them things only women experience,actually mean anything.  So come on do you truly believe he is just as m<b> uch a </b>woman as you. I'd love for you to explain your way out of that one",
