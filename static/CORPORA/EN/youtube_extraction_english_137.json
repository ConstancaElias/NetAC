Anything you see on public transportation, even cable, will make it onto YouTube.\nI don't think media outlets capture much brand loyalty. If Carlin or game of thrones or<b>  sex</b> and the coty switched networks, just about 100% of their watchers would move to the other media outlet imo. (Ok maybe 90%). \nIf any brand loyalty was built, it would be for the comedian themselves. I'm not so sure media outlets would be so heavily invested into that, unless they signed some exclusivity agreement or major production agreement with that comedian for many years.",

I'm in my 20s and watched this purely out of curiosity, and I'm glad I did. It's about so much more than <b> ageism </b>and the advice of developing  multiple skillsets and having many projects at the same time is spot on - kind of what Ari Shaffir recommends in his 4-hour recording that can be found on YouTube - bottom line, practice makes you better and doing comedy in more than one way prepares you for whatever opportunity might come your way in the future.  Definitely going to take this advice. \nThanks<b>  Jerry</b>!",
