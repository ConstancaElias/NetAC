        "postText": "Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has been slammed for changing his profile picture on Twitter to show him talking to a black person, days after being accused of racism for wearing blackface.', 'Mr Trudeau appears to have changed his profile picture within the last few days, meaning the change was made after pictures of him emerged wearing blackface.', 'Old photographs of the Candian prime minister emerged, showing him with a darkened face at an Arabian nights costume party in 2001.', 'Subsequent pictures showed him wearing blackface while performing a version of Harry Belafonte\u2019s \u2018Banana Boat Song (Day-O)\u2019 during a talent show at Jean Brebeuf High School in Quebec, which he graduated from in the early 1990s.', 'Global News also broadcast a brief video of Trudeau in \u2018brownface\u2019 while raising his hands in the air and sticking out his tongue.', 'In the latest incident, he has been accused of insensitivity after changing his picture.', 'One user wrote: \u201cSome of my best friends are black\u201d, Trudeau now has an avatar of him talking to a black person.', '\u2018I kind of feel sorry for him. He is just absurd.\u2019', 'Another added: \u2018Was it a mistake by @JustinTrudeau to change his profile picture to a shot of him smiling at a black man?', '\u2018Is it a demonstration that he\u2019s left his racist past behind, or is his use of people of colour as political props evidence that he hasn\u2019t changed very much?\u2019', 'Mr Trudeau has said that he is truly sorry for what he did.', 'He said: \u2018I\u2019m going to ask Canadians to forgive me for what I did.', '\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I take responsibility for it. It was a dumb thing to do.\u2019",

He put blackface paint head to toe (his jeans are ripped at the knees and you can see his legs are also blackened. He put something in his pants to match the joking stereotype of blackmen, he donned an afro wig and danced like an <b> ape.</b> And, he's STILL allowed to continue his run for Prime Minister and his followers are STILL supporting him. Makes me sick.",
