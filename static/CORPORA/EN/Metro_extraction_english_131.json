        "postText": "An MP has accused the Brexit Party\u2019s founder of \u2018stoking racism and anti-immigrant propaganda\u2019 with a tweet about a non-existent hospital.', 'Catherine Blaiklock claimed \u2018major operations\u2019 are sold in Pakistan to be performed by \u2018the NHS in London\u2019 at \u2018Slough General\u2019, which is not a real hospital.', 'In what looks like a disclaimer, she added: \u2018Somebody told me this is happening. This is a text I received.\u2019', 'The financial trader and hotelier was forced to resign from the party in March over social media comments in which she said Islam was a \u2018threat\u2019 and \u2018incompatible with liberal democracy\u2019.', 'Labour Party MP for Slough Tan Dhesi called her tweet about Slough General \u2018fake news\u2019 and said she was \u2018misleading the British public by creating division within harmonious communities\u2019.', 'He told Metro.co.uk: \u2018It\u2019s so bad on so many different levels.', '\u2018By starting off with \u201coh I\u2019ve just received a text from somebody,\u201d that\u2019s literally just a tactic, it\u2019s a ploy to try to say whatever they want to say in terms of their diabolical and vile views, get those out, but then try to be immune to any sort of criticism or any personal responsibility.\u2019', 'Dhesi said it was an example of the \u2018post-truth environment\u2019 promoted by Donald Trump.', 'He added: \u2018That\u2019s becoming more and more a part of our political landscape, our day-to-day life.', '\u2018Messages are just circulated around, by the time somebody actually points out the truth, by then, thousands of people are already convinced.', '\u2018There needs to be an investigation into whether she actually received that text message and who she received it from.\u2019', He suggested Pakistan was deliberately chosen as an example to stir up hatred against the Muslim community.', 'People were quick to point out that the hospital is not real, that Slough is not in London and that Pakistan has nothing to do with the European Union.', 'A Brexit Party spokesman told Metro.co.uk: \u2018You will find we got rid of her because of this [sort of behaviour].\u2019', 'Blaiklock has been contacted for comment.",
