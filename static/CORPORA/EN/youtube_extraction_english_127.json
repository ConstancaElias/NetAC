I mean it's only natural to move the <b> old </b>workers out and bring in new workers as the older ones have for many decades now, been working longer, meaning positions that would have normally invited in new fresh thinking to the company instead forcing a gap in the generations work force now creating a roadblock, with older workers  now being kept sometimes an entire decade longer. The workers that seem to be out of luck more than likely haven't saved their large salaries instead opting to buy nice stuff. What companies should do it help organize their workforce to save money for retirement and make it clear in the beginning that current methods are allowing workers to stay far to long she it's like keeping 10 boxes on a conveyer belt after it passes it's destination when it's time to put 100 new ones on it, and the belt only holds 100..",

I have seen many skilled older workers (workers working in a large international company for more than 10 years)  been burned out. Those people were unable to change their working habits even if you present them the better way how to do it. Most of them were used to do it somehow and they were not willing to change. At the and of the day you have to improve question and change your working style and skill set that is my motto and it is helping me a lot. Is it unfair for those people who were working for IBM so long? Yes, it is. Unfortunately, that is the world we are living in.",

            "commentText": "I worked for IBM as a contractor from 2007 through 2014. During that period there were at least five layoffs that I was aware of. Nearly all of the non-contract employees affected were long-term employees with 20 or more years at IBM. To be fair, they were given fairly generous severance packages and most were pension eligible. However, most were not ready to retire and were essentially forced into it. Bottom line is IBM management was eliminating older pension-eligible workers in favor of younger workers with limited benefits and no pension. It's <b> age </b>discrimination for profit, plain and simple.\n\nI actually felt lucky that I was contract, I survived those layoffs mainly because I was a fixed, hourly-rate employee with no benefits. By all rights I should have been let go in favor of a direct employee, but it was all about the $$, employees be damned. When they talk about how their employees are their most valued resource, etc., they are flat-out lying.\n\nTowards the end was forced to accept a rate cut, then management decided they would arbitrarily furlough the contractors for weeks at a time (gotta make those year-end numbers look good). I left in the summer of 2014 and haven't looked back, better job now, more money and full benefits. IBM is not a company I would ever work for again. If you're just graduating with a STEM degree and thinking about applying there, don't walk but RUN elsewhere.",

In addition I think it stupid to cry about the 20000 workers that 'disappeared'. I havent recognized any of this and I also work at IBM. Almost everywhere it is the trend to employ more younger workes because they depend to feel more comfortable with this technological era. Tbh I think this video just showed some 'facts' without any concept or real proof. Just think about what all those magazine etc. do these days. Headlining big companies or celebrities to get the most clicks and attention. Feel free to discuss. I really want to hear other opinions.",

You had to be very good, or you needed to learn new skills to stay in the game.     Given the vast change in demand for skills;  The marketplace went from IBM Mainframe, Cobol, CICS IMS in the early eighties to <b> Red<b>  </b</b>>Hat Linux, web based apps and Oracle PL/SQL by 2010.   Why IBM didn't train the existing work force in new skills remains unanswered.   The most likely answer is because anyone who succeeds at the training and gains experience in the new skills is likely to be recruited by headhunters.   Another answer is the current crop of college grads already have academic experience in Unix, Linux, c, MariaDB and SQL so why invest in training when people with the needed experience can be hired at entry level salaries.    The H1B visa has provided a large pool of foreign workers.     I'll note that I took steps to improve my skills several years ago and learned enough Unix/Linux to live in it every day.    Linux sysname 4.16.16-300.fc28.x86_64 #1 SMP Sun Jun 17 03:02:42 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux       It isn't always the case that the workers go<b> t ol</b>d, it's that their skills became obsolete and they didn't keep up with the marketplace.",

            "commentText": "Older employees generally have higher salaries and compensation due to seniority of job titles, and are more likely to be in management positions. When conducting layoffs to restructure or cut costs, high paying and management positions are often the first eliminated. It's not that IBM targeted older workers, it's just that IBM targeted higher paying positions and management positions in its elimination of positions, which happened to impact older workers more.\n\nAs for the \"their performance review discriminatinated against older workers\":\n\nNo, it didn't. Generally, you would expect more of a <b> senior </b>employee than a younger one, as they've had more time to learn, adapt to the environment of the company, and they're getting paid more. So obviously you're not going to hold a fresh grad making $45,000 a year to the same standards as a<b>  senior</b> developer making $120,000 a year. With a fresh grad that needs a lot of assistance, I'd be willing to work with them to get their performance up to invest in that employee. If someone that's been at the company 25 years is needed constant supervision and struggling to perform well, and making 6 figures, I'd be skeptical of that employee's value to the company.\n\nLastly, they offered far better retirement and severence packages than is required by law. They could've fired their employees and provide<b> d nothin</b>g, but instead they provided many months of severance pay and early retirement packages, which were quite nice. If I was working at IBM and was offered an early retirement package, I probably would've taken it.",

If you only get 1 or 2 for great or good, but 3 or 4 for bad or very bad, why would a higher number of points make an employee \"more protected\" from adverse employment decisions? Also, I was left wondering how exactly IBM designed this system to ensure more of these job protection points went to newer employees. You stated that was the case, but didn't explain how they managed this without committing obvious EEO violations.",

No long should it be an umbrella of protection provided by the government (everyone else), through bail outs and walk away bankruptcies. The people who steward (corporate officers, share holders) should have to operate like a sole proprietary and partnerships, where their person assets are on the line. So, if they mess it up, they also can lose their home(s), bank accounts, retirements...\n\nPeople have funny ideas about things, it shows how ignorance always rules. The whole point of incorporation, which comes at the behest of the government, was meant to mitigate risk in exchange for jobs and a tax base, and hopefully more commerce, that's it. If that social contract is not adhered to, then there is no longer any reason to continue it. The fact is, what is the first thing most people do when they start a business (at least here in the US); they go to the government, fill out a form, and pay a fee, of which there are expectations of both parties. Sounds like a contract to me.",

If I've been working at a company 2 years and I'm already performing on par with someone who's been in the same position for 30 then that person is slacking.  It makes sense that the longer you work there the more effective you need to be to be considered a good investment because competence should increase over time.\n\nThe problem fundamentally is that productivity doesn't increase forever.  People don't really want to acknowledge that the older we get the less productive we get as things outside of work take priority like expanding family responsibilities, and eventually, health concerns.  If my productivity goes down by 20% overnight I'm liable to be fired, but if that same drop happens over a 20 year period while my pay continues to rise is it<b>  age</b> discrimination?\n\nWe all ge<b> t ol</b>d, and people making these decisions skew older<b> .  A</b>ge discrimination is complicated at best, and completely fictional at worst.  We've all experienced the person who's been in the department for 30 years and contributes half of what the trainees do but is kept around on pure inertia.  Using the same language and framing for this as you would for racial discrimination is intellectually dishonest.  \n\nFiring someone because you identify them as a poor financial investment is not the same as firing someone because you don't like the color of their skin.  The job of corporations is to make money, the job of government is to take care of their people.  Corporations are not your family, your government, or your feudal overlord.

The objective was to hire/train people so that they, as managers, would be familiar only with IBM products when they left and therefore become loyal customers.  I was there.  Everyone knew it.  Employees were encouraged to go to work for IBM customers.  If you calculated the numbers, in 20 and 30 years, there would be reductions of middle level and upper level management in the company.  The jobs were not the repetitive jobs of a Detroit factory.  You were expected to put in the extra time necessary to keep up with technological changes.  Moreover, every knew that older workers had medical problems, families - so get rid of them.  There was no upward or downward loyalty.",

Decades of prior growth led to anyone who got the job at IBM to keep it, probably regardless weather they were any good at it. Situation changed and suddenly IBM was losing ground to young whippersnappers without a graybeard in the bunch. IBM could just not keep up despite on paper having most experienced workforce a company could hope for. Business downturn means layoffs and in a situation like that, I'm not surprised they targeted older workforce over younger guys.\nYou only do mass layoffs if the company is in the danger of going belly up, by getting rid of least valuable people you give the company best chance of survival. You could prioritize fairness, but everybody fairly being out of job is frankly worse that only some people unfairly being out of job.",

You can expect someone who has just been hired to be as comfortable as knowledgeable in the workplace as someone who has been there for 30yrs and that's good. Because otherwise it just make it harder for young people to get jobs, even more so than it already is. Once they would get hired they would constantly have to face fear of being fired because they can't perform as good as someone who has been there 20plus yrs. in the workforce experienced works eventually do need to get replaced and that's just how it works.",

Why keep them if they are incapable of advancing in their field when they can bring someone new on who has just graduated and is likely more educated in modern systems, not to mention it is scientifically proven that younger employees are more proficient and hard working than older, more complacent employees who have only been doing what is required of them. In the tech world, most of their experience is with systems that are antiquated and no longer relevant. The long time employees who have kept up with the times and always accepted new challenges will most likely not be affected.",

This is easy to do when technology is changing rapidly... why train highly skilled older people when you buy the basic skill off the shelf for nix? How many high tech companies offer 'internships'? i.e. Provide slave labour for the opportunity to secure a (short term) paid job? Remember, young people don't stay young... And then we can talk about the parallel trend of replacing young workers with slave off-shore workers... It is simple economics.

Are those terms in the severance package agreement nonstandard?\n3. Is that point system weighting discriminatory or just a way of giving newly promoted people time to get used to new tasks? Is the fact that people with 15 years of experience are doing better pointswise than people with more experience a sign that the point system is bad or an indication of why they're getting fired in the first place?\n4. I've always heard the inverse situation is the true problem: unmotivated people populating the high level positions who aren't fired out of respect for their \"company loyalty.\" Resulting in younger workers waiting for their death or retirement before being promoted. Is this a <b> common </b>misconception or does it exist and IBM is simply trying to curtail it?",

            "commentText": "As somebody who worked for IBM for a few years, what IBM is doing maybe bad for their workers, but you have to understand that this is necessary, and its not just about outsourcing and H1bs, it's much more nuanced than that.\nA. It's not just the aging workforce that is the problem, it is aging technology. IBM has been losing money for years, and they needed to evolve. This is why everything you here out of Ginni's is \"blockchain\" or \"cloud\". IBM needs to shift the expertise of their employees into these new technologies, meaning somebody who's been doing COBOL for 30 years suddenly needs to do distributed systems or some other flavour of the month technology. If he is basically starting from scratch, it's in IBM's best interest to hire a younger worker because 1. younger workers have a tendency to be familiar with new technology, 2. Even if they are both starting from scratch with this new technology, the new worker is cheaper, and his training him is more cost effective because he can work for 20 years more than the older worker, who you will train for maybe a year but will retire in 5. That isn't even considering the trend for older workers to be harder to train and be dead set on what they know and resist an effort to deviate on that.\nB. A lot of US tech workers have these horror stories with regards to their experiences with outsourcing, but this seems to be the exception and not the rule. Companies are getting more things done and saving more money by outsourcing their all aspects of their systems. As somebody who has first hand experience on this process, I've seen what an army of freshly graduated Filipino IT practitioners can do, and with some guidance, they can handle themselves well and will even sometimes exceed your expectations. And the days of seeing outsourcing as simply call center work is done, these outsourced professionals are designers, testers, architects, support specialists, and every other IT discipline you can think of, all working in a foreign country, available for a fraction of what you will pay for a US team. How are companies supposed to justify retaining experienced but expensive employees when you can hire a whole unit of 50 guys for the equivalent of one of their salaries? \nC. How employees approach work has also evolved. People don't stay at companies for long, even 5 years is considered a long time today. Employees have to keep evolving, learning new skills, looking for new opportunities elsewhere. Gone are the days of retiring at the same company where you started your career. So in order to attract talent, employers have also shifted what they offer, opting for more money upfront, but a less stable job environment. Again, speaking from experience, it may be a bad time to be an employee, but it's a great time to be an independent contractor or freelance agent.\nIBM is simply trying to adapt to the times. Older employees are having a bad break, and what's happening to them isn't fair, but in IBM's mind, if it doesn't do this, its very existence will be in danger.",

If you look at October of 2014, you'll see a sharp <b> spike </b>downward in their stocks, that they've yet to recover from. I remember being there when that happened. Things changed dramatically after that. Much like the story and video say, a lot of very experienced developers never came back after Christmas vacation. Sweeping organizational changes were attempted to be put in place, trying to change to an \"agile and fast approach,\" all of which felt incredibly rushed, desperate, and really didn't scale to the size of the organization they were trying to apply it to. They made a short attempt at trying to adopt a more startup-like young culture with office parties, lunches between upper management and us university interns, and event outings but it just resulted in more alienation of the older demographics.\nAt the end of my internship, our team that had some ~80 student interns was replaced with 15. It felt like they had just given up. A few interns I worked with went back to IBM afterwards, but not many.\nIt was bad. I've never seen a company so desperate to find it's place in a world that had seemingly left it behind, and then just give up.",

            "commentText": "I don't want to sound inconsiderate, but this feels like it's IBM doing their part to combat corporate bloat.  As a company gets older you get jobs that used to be essential, but that get replaced, automated, or incorporated into other areas.  So you end up with older employees where you ask yourself 'What exactly is it that they do...?'  But no one dares to bring it up, because they have seniority.  Even if they don't actually do anything, they've been at the company for decades!\n\nThis is how you get massive corporations that get out-competed by younger start-ups with a tenth of their workforce.  It's because the big guys are carrying a bunch of dead weight.  Just look at Microsoft Office vs freemium competitors like Libre Office.  It's not normal that Microsoft's team is falling that far behind in terms of basic efficiency in a text editor.\n\nI mean, granted, if there is actual discrimination (where an older employee of equal or greater skill to the younger ones gets fired instead of the younger ones) that is wrong.  But I get the feeling that, often with these sort of situations, the employer is getting rid of them because they're no longer useful.  And that's sad, but the company doesn't make a profit by being a charity.",

The reason for this is two fold: \n\n- A younger work force is more willing and able pick up after management incompetence, which is the source of the industry standard practice of \"every time is sprint time\";\n- The industry obsession with the latest technological fad, and it's collective belief that \"new is always better\", which is hardly ever the case. \n\nI, for one, would rather work with a seasoned Java veteran that can tell me months in advance why something will not work, than a bunch of JavaScript kids that will eagerly jump down a cliff after me.",

There's one CEO at the top, a handful EVP's, more middle management, and the bulk of the workforce as direct labor at the bottom. Each year young people graduate, and enter at the bottom of the organization. Some of the previous generation moves up the chain to middle management, some middle management moves up to become EVP's, and maybe one EVP becomes a new CEO. But there are more people entering than moving up, and when a company's growth stagnates, someone will be shown the door.\n\ntl;dr Google up or out.",

However certain factors must be considered, such as the costs to keep the person employed and whether they are keeping up with ever changing work environments. If what they do can be done by someone they can pay less, it is fair for them to let go of the more expensive employee. There is no emotion in the business world when it comes to the bottom line. Also, not all, but many older generations do not stay up to date on changing technology. These individuals can not only be a drag on on productivity but they can be a security risk as proven by the increasing hacks going on around the world  This is of course not unique to our older population. But in general they are more likely to stick to what they know and be afraid of change. It's just human nature.",

The things is : older \"workers\" have experience and are skilled but at the same time are slow and not very productive, comparing to the young counter part. They are more fitted as \"manager\", \"adviser\", etc.. being workers, the ones that implement/make things. Also , for the fields of computing ( IT, software, hardware, services,etc..) that IBM is in now , things changes so fast, like every 3 years or so, oldie are at disadvantage... I think best <b> age </b>are below 40-45 for \"workers\", after that the performance go down hill.  I hope the best for IBM and their staff ( current and fired ).. \n\n \n.",

Even high-tech jobs can be done to a similar standard in China/India for much cheaper making it very difficult to be as economically viable in a developed country (unless the gov props them up). Cheap labour did exist before, BUT the key factor is cheap, high-speed, high-throughput global transportation of goods which makes it so easy to relocate as a company. Thus the workers of one country don't just directly compete against each other, but now workers from other countries too. Supply goes up, wages fall.\n\nWith regards to IBM's <b> old </b>tech,<b>  nobody</b> can crack those remotely sure, but they're so out-dated hardware and software-wise, they're practically useless. For uncrackable storage, they'd rather use an isolated modern server (which would only take <30 people to develop and maintain, not in the 10000s) or just make the switch to accessible networks with much stronger encryption and security systems. The ease of access and usability drops their costs, speeds up business (thus more revenue), which would happily make up for the risk associated with a breached server. (NB by risk here, I mean the product of probability of breach and cost of breach, like a decision matrix)",

They are great in theory, but if a company has to compete globally it cant keep people just because of seniority and such things.  I suspect these lay offs had more to do with wages than <b> age </b>itself.  Of course people with the longest service and highest wages are going to tend to be older.  I just don't understand how its better to lay off everyone because of lost market share than its is to pare down expensive workers to stay competitive.  It sucks, but no one has realistic alternatives.",

It's cheaper for them to hire and train from scratch two college kids than keep one aging employee that isn't as flexible. As for the remaining IBM employees, be mindful of your salary and how expensive you may appear to a company. I've always tried to be worth my weight in gold, to out perform others. Be mindful what benefits you have, fringe or otherwise, entitlements you've earned due to your seniority. All these sound nice but maybe make yourself too visible to the bean counters. Most of the older guys I know in this industry or others, have simply banded together, formed a new company (smaller) and subcontracted out to their previous employer.",

However, the performance charts seem to indicate a different story given that there is a clear motive to bring down the points of <b> senior </b>employees through a biased grading system - looks like it's just the beginning of the apocalypse where the stage is being set for mass exodus of<b>  senior</b> employees in near future and IBM wants to make sure its ass is covered. \n\nOn another note, this is something that is happening in IT services firms in India on a massive scale (read hundreds of thousands o<b> f senio</b>r employees) to cut costs and has happened before in t<b> he a</b>ge of manufacturing and automation  worldlwide -<b>  so noth</b>ing new about it.",

            "commentText": "IMHO, older workers delaying their retirement is part of why the unemployment rate is so high. The job market is kind of like a popular restaurant with a line of people waiting to be seated. Older workers are the people currently occupying some of the tables. They've finished their dinners and paid the check. But instead of getting up and leaving, they're continuing to sit at the table and chat. Technically they have every right to do that, but the people in line waiting for a table suffer for it. The same applies in job availability and mobility in several industries. \n\nI once worked at a company where the only chance to be hired or promoted was if someone above you retires or dies. I have a lotta friends who have been rotting away in middle management for decades waiting for their 70+ superior to retire so they can finally get promoted. Meanwhile, the superior is taking long lunches, longer vacations or may be coming to work only a few days a week. Yet and still they're allowed to maintain their full salary and job title. The consequences are paid by the people under them who are expected to take on some of the supervisors' uncompleted work. They're basically given the majority of the work associated with being promoted, without the title or salary increase. So it's no wonder that even employed young people are struggling.",

Work for an employer a few years, then develop your own product or service. If you are at the mercy of an employer, you are playing lotto. You are one upper management decision away from a Dear John letter. The CEOs get bonuses when deadweight drops. There is no pride anymore in having an employee have a lifetime living from your business.\n\nMy last consulting job at GE opened my eyes. Hired at a crappy hourly rate, manager told us we like the Dell PCs. After 3 years the depreciation or expenses or whatever crosses a line and it just pays to get new ones that can be deducted.

Meanwhile, you overlook the fact that most of those older workers made higher salaries.  You can make a case for or against firing more expensive workers based on their value to the company without assuming that they are somehow lacking in drive or initiative.  I posit that one of the reasons IBM sucks now is because they squandered their strength as a hardware company to become a \"solutions\" company.  They laid off a lot of great people behind that folly and the company is practically irrelevant in tech today.",

Since we had hired mostly older and experienced IT staff, many of them were fired, and did not receive any severance because they only worked for IBM for a few months. In addition, the quality of IT system dropped drastically, so my company wound up losing millions in on that contract, as well as a lot of good employees.",

It's a shame, but that's the tech sector. It's a fast moving industry, and IBM was very close to being left behind. \n\nThat wouldn't make as good of a story obviously and it's a lot easier to only consider one side and make IBM look like a corporate monster",

The only people they sell to these days are large corporations and small businesses. And they dominate in that market because of their size. And they'll be even more dominant because they just cut their costs down by cutting employees that probably had higher salaries than the kids who just got out of college and started working for IBM",

I can very easy get a PC with no IBM components. That can out preform one that does. Might cost a little more. Still my moral values are more than worth the difference. Without the puplic market they lose investors and fall apart. Basic economics. Just a matter of how important your values are to you and if you have any moral. So...... Do you have moral?",

Also, if you bothered to listen to the video, you'd know that most of these workers were deemed good enough for the same job or a promotion.

They have years of accumulated raises, are closer to retirement when they can start draining retirement benefits and increasingly incur more healthcare expenses. (One of the travesties of private, corporate-tied healthcare in the U.S. is that companies cut costs by betting on employees staying healthy then get hit with the bill when employees start actually needing care.)\n\nTrue, your observation about the raw stats are probably right. If IBM threw the \"you're fired\" dart at the employee dart board at random, they'd likely hit more older workers anyway. But, the video's \"points\" chart didn't show that. It showed that they didn't just fire people \"getting bad at their jobs.\" Rather, given two workers who were competent at their jobs, they aimed their darts pretty pointedly at the older worker (for all the cold, calculated reasons given above).",

Its full time to support the job (many times way over full time) and the company demands it because of contracts. If the older worker wants to learn new tech, it has to be done on their limited free time. And being older, what free time you get means more time with family demands, taking care of older parents, etc..\nOlder workers had raises and more likely are in <b> old </b>fashion stock/bonus plans, which is rarely given to new hires. So yes, older workers are expensive. \nAs the<b>  old</b> tech is phased out, the new hires were working on next gen products. Only a few older workers are kept, the rest are given the boot. If the employee was nice, its usually a layoff package. If they were troublesome or a complainer, its usually a termination based on a magic HR rule invented for that day.\nIts less expensive to hire new and place into the new products than transfer older employees. Older employees also have many drawbacks to get a new job. Starting salary is higher, hiring manager knows that older worker will need more doctor visits, leave early for kid stuff, less likely to work a 90hr/week. etc....  \nSo even if the older worker will accept a paycut to get back into the workforce, hiring managers do not want someone older than them (fear of someone knowing more than them), and same reasons above.\n\nMy advice, be a contractor and job hop every chance you get. Make sure you are always working on the latest trend. Never EVER stay in one place for more than 2 years. The raises you will get on job hopping are much better than the farce of \"long term bonus plans\" on staying in a job. \nSource: 18 years as a gd dam tec<b> h monke</b>y, getting 1% raises, making millions for a company and my only reward are many kudo emails from ceo/exec staff, working on holidays, many odd titles as systems engineer/senior programmer/QA analyst/sales engineer/ staff engineer. \nGo into medicine. They will pay overtime. Eventually everyone gets sick so there is always demand. Until they make a medical robot, you're job will never be outsourced/laidoff. And experience is usually valued there. Most places pay for training on new ways of medicine.\nMe? 45, last job moved to china. 2 years looking for work. Looking to become a copy machine repair man.

I could tell you about my father and you probably would HOPEFULLY be at least a little skeptical (but he had a pretty impressive life nonetheless).\n\nI tend to be skeptical of any anecdote that doesn't closely match what I have seen myself.  Maybe that fellow's father DID succeed at IBM and is still there.  Maybe it's also due to hard work and staying current.\n\nMy experience has been that young STEM workers have a very difficult time taking a long-term project from beginning to end.  It's not their fault, because they've never done it in real life (imperfect specs, imperfect data, office politics, unrealistic expectations, etc.).   The last I read, roughly FIFTY PERCENT of software projects fail completely.  I was lucky - mine all worked, but I also took a bit more time planning for the unexpected.  We rarely hear about projects that fail, but experienced workers can spot doomed projects pretty quickly, but what company wants a bunch of graying forty-somethings around?  Ewwww!\n\nBottom line: beware of confirmation bias, and don't assume all business decisions are rational.",

They put that on a shelf too because they believed computers would always rely on a keyboard and command line to be operated.\n\nIBM eventually realised that they were being slaughtered at the marketplace because all upstart companies were run and populated by upstarts who could tell what was or wasn't going to be fashionable over the next five years, while the majority of their workforce became dinosaurs.  Not all <b> elderly </b>employees, but the majority of them.  They were late to realise that tech was something you had to have a hard-coded disposition for, not every person will stay at the vanguard of what's new, but young people do that by their very nature.\n\nIt's not that difficult a concept to grasp if you've ever seen a tech documentary, the same happened in the UK with Sinclair, his young employees wanted to get into the home computer market while he thought every young person would rather own a pocket calculator.",

Unfortunately, the people who are in charge of the budgets think only in terms of quarter to quarter, so it looks like they save money hiring someone cheap.\n\nIt's like that saying, \"If you think it's expensive to hire a professional wait until you hire an amateur\".\n\nMy last job did this, constantly hiring project managers right out of college because they were cheap.  We ended up losing clients and employees because of how bad they would manage projects.",

People tend to make around the same for the same position titles in each company and those who have been in the position longer or have substantial more skills and experience earn a bit more. The company isn't even allowed to ask about <b> age </b>and the only giveaways are what you put on your resume (leave off older companies and your graduation year). If someone went back to school or did a code school and self taught themself to be a programmer and previously they were something completely different, companies are not going to pay them more just because they are older.<b>  Ageism</b> by and large heavily impacts those 40 and older. Again, the main issue for those younger is almost always related to lack of experience and it can be tough to find your foot in the door somewhere to get the experience needed. For those 40 and older, if they find our you<b> r ag</b>e, they will just not hire you or try to get you to quit or fire you (unless you are in upper management level positions).",

The problem is that the employees or customers have so little power in the face of the corporations, or, sadly, corrupt government officials. <b> Nobody </b>is going to challenge either a contract or a waiver in court when it costs tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars to do so, not unless they happen upon the right lawyer and have the right circumstances. Only way for protections for things like<b>  ageism</b> is to better codify it in law. The video shows how difficult it is to sue i<b> n ag</b>e discrimination cases, despi<b> te a</b>ge discrimination (legally that's 40+) being similarly illegal<b>  to r</b>ace discrimination.\n\nThat's how it works for both at will and contract employees. You could make an employee waive their rights to press charges if the company decided to use their spouse for the sport of hunting humans. That doesn't mean that part of the contract is actually legally binding...a ridiculous example, yes, but it's to illustrate that a company can have you sign anything, and they can threaten you in an attempt to enforce it, but that doesn't mean the company somehow automatically will win in court because you signed a waiver or contract. BUT by the very fact that you would have to challenge them in court makes most of these contracts and waivers essentially valid for most individuals stuck with them...",

This idea is simple and fairly easy to understand... Hence why it is so popular, but it's just not that simple. It's not. \n\nSo when politicians says they're making more jobs by signing things in favor of business, people get happy and re-elect said politician... Not understanding that some of the things they're signing/passing (I'd wager most) are actually working against the employees. Most Americans work a retail/service job now and guess what? Most come with either no benefits/rights or very minimal. This <b> transition </b>happened during the 2000s era recession and it made ppl desperate enough to agree to these contracts of signing away our rights. Pence shot down a bill that would have eliminated mandatory arbitration in favor of business...\n\nWelcome to America where you're a social security number that pays taxes to pay for bigger better business favoring legislation and a bigger better standing military. You're quality of life and health are meaningless and you're shamed as lazy, weak, and/or stupid for questioning why no one can afford healthcare benefits, retirement, and why have a disproportionately high maternal death rate.

Coincedentaly I`ve just written my english finals( as a foreign language) on a similar topic(also regarding big corporations): Monsanto and how they have benefited from the fact that a lot of people, aspecialy in the US, don`t seem to have a problem with companies, which openly proclaim their intention is to make as much money as possible and that the F.D.A alone is responsable for the safety of their GM-products. Monsanto has the money to do the research themselfs. I still think there is such a thing as corporate social responsabilty but that seems to be neglegtet by a lot of people. This reckles kind of capitalism will only bring with it more problems, more hate and more taxes to fund more agencies and keep the bureaucratic machine going.",

Contracts of any kind require equal compensation and informed consent to be legally binding, this is why I can't slip in a 'I get to burn your house down' in a contract you signed to borrow my lawn mower. 1.) Borrowing my lawnmower isn't worth as much as your house and 2.) You might not have known/understood what it meant when I slipped that clause in a 30 page paper to borrow my lawnmower.\n\nIn IBM's victim's case, the question would be, \"Is violating your rights as an older citizen worth the pension they give in exchange, and did you understand that's what was going in when you signed the contract.\" The answer to both of these questions is no, but you'd have to prove in a court of law that 1.) IBM's layoffs unfairly targeted older workers, 2.) That the victims didn't understand the rights they had when they were signing, and 3.) That the pensions aren't enough compensation for having your rights violated. Unfortunately all that requires much more than what a YouTube comment can provide.\n\nContrary to popular belief in the replies, labor laws exist so that your employer can't treat you however they want, regardless of what they'd like you to believe. Cynicism is what abusers thrive on.",

Unless someone has one of the last few models of power pc Macs or is watching this on their wii u (I think the Wii can't do youtube any more...), there's pretty much no chance. IBM is really more of a back end company, focusing on things like main frames and services, not computers as we know them. It's possible someone is watching this on an instance of an OS running on IBM hardware remotely, but, again, unlikely.\n\nAn no, IBM didn't invent the pc, in really any sense of the term. They were just the most popular for quite a while and, so, are easily associated with it. If I were to be pedantic, the Altair 8800 was the first true \"pc\".",

Blankenbaker in 1971, has the honour of being the first \"Personal Computer\".  However, the CTC corporation's Datapoint 2200 terminal was released in 1970, and was later shown to be a fully-functional desktop computer in its own right, even though it wasn't marketed that way.\n\nRegardless of who actually did it first, it's quite safe to say that the PERSONAL Computer was definitely not invented before 1970, and certainly not by Turing or Babbage.",

It's also pretty easy for young people just out of college or still in their 20s to start tech companies and I imagine many prefer their employees be younger than them so there's less chance they will seem more qualified and on a personal level, make them feel younger and les<b> s ol</b>d school corporate by being around a bunch of young people.",
