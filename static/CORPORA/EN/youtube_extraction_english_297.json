Everyone told us not to visit because it was dangerous and so I had to go and investigate to see if it was as dangerous as everybody told me or if it was something different. What I found surprised and shocked me. Welcome to the party at Lunik 9! ",

By banishing them for so long, every generation of gypsies learned that people are bad. By learning that they isolated themselves from the world. By isolating themselves they didn't have a chance to learn how to be a \"modern human\" and remained in the medieval stages. (what? you didn't know knights shat in their armor and people made bath 1 time in a year ?).   Just like a kid that's constantly marginalized and shouted at. He becomes a bully to protect himself... just like gypsies.",

            "commentText": "All the romani hate in the comments is disgusting. People are born into circumstances which are difficult; this is the life of any group with a history of nomadism. With the urbanization of the industrial revolution, nomadic life was made impossible, and those nomads who settled down had no material history of privilege in that society. Where are you going to put your trash, the trash which was forced upon you through modernization, if there is no designated dump? \n\nThis video made me happy, to see the thriving life in what are less than favourable conditions. Instead of scapegoating the problems of your <b> nation </b>upon an underprivileged class, why don't you call into question the Powers which stochastically regimented them into slums, and prevented them from higher education, basic living necessities such as a garbage dump, standardized plumbing, and so on. People are not driven to \"live in squalor\" out of choice or out of cultural nature, this is a<b>  racist</b> lie meant to justify continuing the injustices and the peoples' ignorance of said injustices.\n\nIf you want to actually change these peoples' lives and bring them out of this situation, don't continue the hate which justifies their oppression. How must it feel as a mother knowing that your children will never grow past what you have given them, to have \"no chance\" to leave Lunik 9? So much of the prejudice I see pointed towards the romani people is echoed within the prejudice agains<b> t blac</b>k people in my own country, and they both have similar material conditions which have lead for the need to justify that prejudice. Given no other choice, ma<b> ny bla</b>ck people in America live in redlined houses infested with lead, and neighborhoods with no public support or urbanized systems.\n\nI reiterate this once mo<b> re: Nob</b>ody chooses to live in oppress<b> ion. No</b>body willfully throws their trash out their window knowing that a garbage truck will come next thur<b> sday. N</b>obody commits a crime for money not out of desperation. You people who reduce the struggles of the Romani down to<b>  thei</b>r race, or their culture, are fundamentally ignorant of how societies form and how upper classes make their profits.",

So tell ne if u are a mother or a father of lets say 2 kids u are getting just over 100 euro a month what will u do pay for your bins or feed your kids? They cant pay for water or electricity the ones that emigrate come back and buy houses in which they pay for everything a normal citizen would. Even if a person really wanted to be successful it is impossible in this country as we are not treated the same as we have no rights as we are blamed and are treated because of how we will but no one will ever say well hold on why are these people doing all this well because they are not treated fair and yes there are gypsys that will never change and thats because they will never forget and forgive even if they move to a different country. A lot of it also goes back to where they are not very educated as it goes back to the government as they have not provided the same for  gypsys as the normal slovakians. This is the same thing as you would have someone in Nigeria or other poor countries but in today's world if u are <b> racist </b>against a<b>  black</b> person u are in deep trouble so everyone has to treat eachother right and as the years go by the new generations take this one as a normal thing an<b> d racis</b>m slowly but surely disappears because no one is bo<b> rn raci</b>st!",

A system that has prevailed until today and bears <b> crazy </b>fruits - like these massrapes, heavy discrimination in schools and lynchmobs. It's basically like Apartheid or Slavery-System back then in USA. And just like the jews who have other reasons to live in Diaspora they are being discriminated heavily ever since in the western sphere.

The parents don't support kids in education and therefore the circle of uneducated people continues in the next generations. It is similar to australian Aborigines. They get everything from state, education is not important for them, they live from one day to the other, not thinking about the future. And the only work they can do is digging holes when something is repaired on the streets infrastructure.",

Wow, maybe cause you went there announced and escorted by someone of their people, don't you think? It's like visiting a gipsy camp in wherever in the world. Or i guess they were so nice cause all the robbers, criminals, human traffic bosses, children thievs and beggars had gone to Italy. I've seen camps like that, being no-man's land, where NEITHER THE POLICE WOULD GO! They live into their garbage, raise their Kids to become professional robbers before schoolage and yet they've got the most luxurious cars near to their Vans. I've known only a couple of families Who wanted to lead a normal Life out of those camps. Very good people, italians like i am, going to work and everything. But it's no more than 10% of them.",

I also ran into them in London, telling me they're Bosnians, and by calling me Sheikh or saying the traditional greeting of Islam. But I immediately knew they were just walking around pretending to be Bosnian, assuming that we would feel sorry for fellow Muslims, and that it would be <b> crazy </b>for them to say that they're Syrians because we would immediately converse with them in Arabic, and assuming that no Arab would speak a word or two of Serbo-Croatian. Nonetheless, they don't look anything like neither Bosnians or Syrians, and whenever I uttered zdravo kako si! They were lost. I later found out from the local Londoners that most of them are gypsies from Romania, who own villas back in Romania from all the money they gather here.",

They were asked to pay a very low, heavily subsidized fee to maintain the building and provide the water, heat and electric. They refused to pay. They were asked to leave because the government could not afford to maintain the buildings without the maintenance fees, but the gypsies refused to go. \n\nThe government eventually stopped providing services because the gypsies became squatters, living in accommodation that they were no longer legally entitled to. But one person in each building pays his electric and water, so the utilities company must keep the building connected to the system. From that single connection, the rest of the gypsies steal what they want.\n\nShould the other Slovak taxpayers now completely subsidize these people who are destroying the buildings? They pull out all the wiring and even steel from any empty units. How much are the Slovak taxpayers supposed to indulge?\n\nYou have a naive view of these people. They will gut these buildings of everything of value and will simultaneously have left wing groups advocating the government to build them yet another block of housing. Then it just begins all over again.\n\nIn their lives they will do everything to avoid contributing to their society, yet will bleed it of resources from cradle to the grave.",

It's very easy to just say that they are all at fault, they ruin everything and only to crime, but this is so absolutely ignorant and people don't know the context. You can see documentaries about it (about gypsies in Eastern Europe) and the thing is even the ones that \"make it\" have jobs, kids go to school, have apartments are usually still treated like shit in Eastern Europe. Sure, they might go through their life 80% of the time not having any problems, but then that 20% something happens, for example, the story one documentary followed was of a <b> gypsy </b>man being assaulted almost to death by locals, and the police, hospital, everyone just tried to get rid of him while the people who assaulted him mocked the family. There are 100000's of instances like that. Sure, there are all sort of programs to try to help and integrate to society, but most of it is just a show. Now think of it, if you can't even feel safe to not be assaulted just for existing, what do you do? You go back to \"ghetto\". It might not be the safest place, the hygiene is shit, education is forbidden, but at least there is commmunity that will not stab you for just existing. And so the cycle continues.",

I personally do not like gypsies, because they got money for their kids so that is why they got a lot of kids, they do not usually work, sometimes they fight white people for no reason etc. Yes there are some good and talented and honess like some that are famous musicians here in slovakia  but 90% of them or at least here in Slovakia are disgrace and I am sometimes not proud to be Slovak because of our politicians and gypsies.",

The area has never been built for Gypsies, or Romani, as you say, as the government policy at that time was about absolute integration of minorities. It was projected as a modern neighborhood with a perhaps tad bigger living standard, with apartments intended to be primarily given to army personnel, army veterans, and other state employees. I don't know how it escalated into the state it is now, but, indeed, the non-Romani inhabitants were increasingly leaving the apartments, the prices of which were rapidly going down, and, more Romanis were going there instead. \n\n\nThe fact there's communal waste all around is due to failure of most inhabitants to pay their municipal bills. Not just waster disposal bills, by the way. Heat, water, electricity.. It's not that all of them didn't pay, but overall, there was a huge debt which was growing, and there was no solution to it. Not that the government was willing to invest any time or resources into it, they were always too busy snatching money off the state budget, from under their voters' sight.",

If you look at googlemaps, you have just two or three ways to get there from the Dresden city :). Dub\u00ed used to be really bad ten years ago. I had a friend living there. Prostitues everywhere, not these days anymore. We can only guess, mate :-D. The contrast between our republic and Germany is big even here in Pilsen. We often go shopping to Germany. Cheaper, better quality, more quantity products. They have better roads, cleaner surroundings, nicer houses etc. :) Thanks! I love our beer too!  Unfortunately its not so good as it used to be, but still one of the best beers in the world. if you get it properly draught, taste like butter! :-)) If you want to visit Pilsen, don't hesitate, airtickets are cheap for you :). I mean like 60 quids two way ticket to Prague from london, then bus to Pilsen - 1hr drive - plus drive from the airport to the bus terminal (20 mins). And if you want, I'd be glad to show you around our city. Not just the trip advisor or tourist guid would show you. :-)\n\nEdit: I've found tickets from London to Prague for 18 quids, two way ticket (return) in Janury. I bet you can earn it in one hour in a job :-). It is cheap.",

It\u00b4s not because I\u00b4m defending Slovakia or Europe there, but it gives me sense to mention this on travel channel, because next time other video can be about other countries and I don\u00b4t want to feel like \u00b4\u00b4Oh that\u00b4s disgusting! I would be so affraid and I don\u00b4t ever want to travel to this country.\u00b4\u00b4 even when in reality the bad looking place (or whatever) was just an exception and I would be absolutely missing other beautiful and enjoyable places to visit in that country. For example close to Lunik IX there is Ko\u0161ice city and it\u00b4s worth the visit. I don\u00b4t want to feel like this about other countries and I would appreciate to see things I can\u00b4t see from youtube in some context and be explained to me to have an idea what the overall situation really is and how much whats showed to me is different from the rest of the country maybe, because even 5km from place like this you can find completely different life :)",

I honestly believe God's gift of heaven/hell is to be born again randomly as any human on the planet (as much as you cant imagine like this, there are equally very rich people who cant imagine living like you), and if it's an overbreed dump, thats the \"heaven\"! that you'll inherit. Whats sad is this open borders thing just allow lazy people to come and wreck whatever nice things caring people take the time to build/make! If you really weren't lazy, you'd make your OWN towns etc. heavenly, doesn't take much to plant flowers, trees, section away rubbish, and most importantly NOT HAVE A TON OF CHILDREN because we need to keep enough lumber, land and meadow etc. to make life happy. The bees are now suddenly dying out..our precious bees that made our country beautiful with flowers because we had time and a low enough population to plant for them, to give back to us. Botany is a wonderful thing, natural dyes etc. yet its soo unimportant apparantly now, having the latest plastic sh*t matters more than natural fibres people like me love to weave like reed, the various types of sheeps wool etc. In the past in UK our people kept it ECO with cardboard egg box, recycled milk bottles, paper flour bags etc..",

They also don't care about the community there in and cause havoc for weeks before they move on and repeat the process somewhere else. Just look at there own neighbourhood!

That seems like a health hazard and I wouldn't necessarily say they are to blame in making it a shithole if they aren't provided with the resources to maintain the property, or don't have the means themselves to do it. They look like they keep their personal living space pretty pristine. Seems like if they had the resources they would want to maintain the outside as well. Paint,bins,plaster, garbage pick up etc all costs money and While I am clueless as to the politics of this place,  I would say they aren't provided with the means and don't have it themselves?

There are regions that are filthy shitholes and some ends that are beautiful and modern. I love your content but this negative image that Calcutta has been bearing is severely denigrating. I mean it has accepted vast influx of refugees from neighboring countries and states - yet it has accepted everyone as its own. \nI am sorry if I am getting to personal with Calcutta - it's my home, my city and I love everything about it",

In Romania, we have our own share of gypsies living here, yes. \n\nUnfortunately, our government is responsible for the confusions between the Romanian and Roma, romanes, romi, rom etc. words. They thought it would be a great fucking idea to call them Romi instead of tigani so they won't be discriminated, and now, us Romanians ended up being discriminated all over Europe instead, because when a<b>  gypsy</b> goes from Romania to UK for example and they call themselves Roma, Romi or whatever, people from UK will say \"all right, so they are Romanians\", well no, they are not. They don't look like us, they don't behave like us, they think the laws exist only for fun, they refuse to get integrated in society, they avoid taxes, they refuse to send their kids to schools, they refuse to work honest jobs, they prefer making tons of kids and living off their allowance, and then we are the ones who end up being discriminated and judged by other Europeans for the shit the gypsies do in their countries.\n\nI suggest you take a trip to Romania and see for yourself, we're also a forme<b> r communis</b>t country and there's stuff around for you to be interested in.

To be fair, it's only a degree or two beyond what you will find in the tenement slums on the outskirts of any major city in Europe. And the difference is largely superficial. Many of the people here make regular trips to the UK. Flights to and from Kosice are full of local Roma. I have absolutely no idea how this set-up works, but it's obviously an established system of some kind. I'm not judging it. If I was born into this place and had the chance, I'd be making a beeline for anywhere, even Derby.",

During warszaw pact times the Gypsies had guaranteed work and their children were forced to go to normal school the whole situation was getting steadily better but after fall of USSR all the achievements went backwards again. There are other places like this who rarely people go, also not journalists. For example in the border-area of Czech and Poland, by the city of Ostrava there are quite big of these communities.",

Every state have different language & culture. We have more than 100s of communities living here. Gypsies are one of them. Some of them migrated to Europe centuries ago. Some are still here in India. They live in the same condition just like they live in Europe. Even if you give them 1 million $, they would stay in slum. Only few have merged into mainstream. They belong to Rajasthan and Sindh of Pakistan. That's why Gypsies are called Sinti (Derived from Sindhi)",

But this would be a prime case of imitation being sincerest form of flattery. Your channel really is one of the very best on Youtube, and I'm delighted to see that you're approaching a million subscribers. I have been travelling to many obscure parts of Europe myself in the past few years, and I have also somewhere at the back of my mind considered ripping off your concept, but being painfully aware that I could never make it anywhere near as good as yours, that will never happen.

There are dozens of gypsies slums around Slovakia which looks much worse that this.The biggest problem with the gypsies is that they like this way of life, they like to get social aid for free and they rather live in such condition than working hard and have something better. It is their mentality, which is hard to change. And the worst is when the <b> gypsy </b>people are living together in bigger \u00a0settlements.",

You see, they're given a social welfare based on how many children they have (so, naturally, they make a lot of children just to have more money), they're also given fresh houses (Slovaks are really outraged about this) and they turn them into shitholes. They have really poor manners, yelling, stealing, giving smokes and <b> alcohol </b>to the minors... No wonder normal polite Slovaks don't like them. The worst part is when you say something bad about them, their lifestyle or anything, you're automatically branded a<b>  racist</b> (even when you're pointing out something which ha<b> s nothin</b>g to do with skin color). Not too long ago we had a situation when o<b> ne gyp</b>sy (he was incarcerated not too long prior to the incident) killed a man in front of a pub... just like that out of nowhere. He killed a normal, hardworking man without any reason. That's why gypsies have a bad reputation. I also have an all around bad experience with gypsies and I don't like them in general but that doesn't mean I mind a polite, hardwork<b> ing gy</b>psy who's trying to prove that not all of them are like this.",

                    "commentText": "Good Sir, or M'me. Been to Mexico, seen the Romani community in Jalisco, and it's true they get along with the Mexicans much better, and they' re accepted much more while still largely keeping to themselves in their communities (historical reasons.) The issue between Romani communities and the majority in post Eastern Bloc countries stems mainly in how the governments dealt with them in general. It is a very complex issue, which points at faults on both sides. However, the greatest deal of trouble was, and still is, caused by the people in power. Thanks to the people in power the antagonism between the two prevails, it even grows stronger, sadly. \n\n\nMost Romani see the gadzhos almost as an impersonification of all evil, someone not to trust, not to respect. Then, some, or many, depends on the place, too, they feel entitled to show that distrust and disrespect in all-out way. Among 'gadzhos', there's belief, often taken as an ultimate truth, that Gypsies only want to be 'parasites' on the system, steal, avoid work, take any benefits their home country can offer, without any chance for a change. And they treat them accordingly.  Many of the Romani <b> ethnicity </b>in these countries are engaged in all kinds of criminal activities, which can be also highly organized - targeted against those gadzhos.. most often, they do not commit these crimes against each other.. Oh, the hate. Also, more often than not, Romani kids ignore the school, as their parents seem to not care at all. Other side of the coin then shows that these kids are outsiders the moment they begin attending a school. There is a stigma coming along with their origins. Are you a Romani kid who so much wants to show that you're not who they think you are? You want to get along with the rest, have friends, etc.? Tough luck. \n\n\nI remember a tiny Romani kid crying when on a walk with his kindergarten group, as only a teacher was willing to hold his hand, and even she seemed somewhat uncomfortable doing so. Heard kids talking about dirty Gypsies. (Yes, you have these families that do not care much about hygiene, and it's the part of the<b>  Gypsy</b> stigma, as if simply all of them were filthy.) Another thing - a public belief that Gypsies, in general, ar<b> e dum</b>b, uneducated, and if they can land a job, there's a risk they'd steal there, or make trouble. And that they actually do not want to work, they' re lazy, and they enjoy social benefits offered by the state. As a result, it can be extremely hard for an adult Romani to find a job. There's a plenty of Romani people who are skilled, skillful, even really educated, but they are unlikely to land a job where there is non-Romani competition. And guess what, it hints about where that goes. Reliance to social support, if possible. If not, they can opt to leave for other countries,(which, however is not always an option to them), or join some others who are crime-positive. I managed to know these Romani people in Slovakia, and abroad. I quickly earned their respect as they got to know me, and gave me the chance to see they are people like all of us.\n\n\nI had a chance to travell, visit some countries around the world, and get to know the people there. We're all the people, are the same after all. The cultural differences are always a painting on the top after all; underneath, we're all the same. But, I also acknowledge that I learned to understand that only thanks to getting to know these people. To open myself to knowledge, embrace it. It is not that everyone achieve this. Anyways, there are people with power to influence us, who could unite the people if they only had the will to do it. Instead, they keep dividing us, as it serves their own agendas.",

The one guy that seems to speak honestly and seems to want to have a better life is the one that was asking to be judged based on his heart.\n\nThanks <b> bald </b>for sharing videos like this, it really is an eye opener to the different cultures and view points from places that many of us don't get to see, your videos are the very definition of a window to the outside world",

It was very <b> common </b>in Soviet era in countries that were members of Warsaw Pact. There are severel disctricts in Polish major cities (such as Cracow and Warsaw) when they plan to re-settle criminals and put them between police officers and they families. In all cases - these \"experiments\" failed. Only criminals and poor families were moved and flats planned for officials were sold or were for rent. This resulted in almost no-go zones and such places are dangerous till today. Lunix X is definitely the worst case.",

They don't get basic things like electricity, water, cleaning , schools etc... People says they're involved in crimes. What you expect than if you behave like that? They have to survive. They had no choice other than crimes to earn some money. Hates of to them even after hundreds of years of harrassment they survived and living lively.

If you give them free housing, it will end up like in the video, or if they are the caravan living type, they will strip it down and sell the materials. Now, there are some good, well adjusted, integrated gypsies, indistinguishable from the rest of the people from my country if I'm being honest. But this isn't prejudice. It is very easy to realize which of the gypsies I am talking about in this video.",

Did I say anything about them being brown? The reason they are \"turning white\" is because some prostitute their wives, daughters, sisters (no all - NOT ALL . . .  NOT ALL!!!) They are a public menace and a burden on tax payers who owe them <b> NOTHING.</b> You did make a great point tho, they've been in Europe for hundreds of years and they refuse to assimilate and there's no reason to think that's going to change any time soon. That's something we should keep in mind when it comes to the current batch of migrants, are they still gonna be demanding free housing and assistance in hundreds of years? Will people like you still be defending them in 2319?",

Basically, all people who have a mutation that makes skin other than <b> black </b>are basically white. Most people from Europe do not originate from Europe, that's why example most European languages are from the Indo-European language tree, etc. \n\n\nSo what if the \"gypsies\" originate from Europe, they have lived in Europe for a long time, about 1500 years.  They moved to central  Europe about the same time as the Germanic tribes (Slavs.etc) and have mixed a lot with other Europeans, so genetically they are as Europeans as most nations in Europe.  Finland, where I\u00b4m also from, have Romanian people and they do not \"transform\" areas to a rubbish tip, same thing in all Nordic countries. \n\n\nSome people leech of the welfare system, most don\u00b4t. All ethnicities have something positive to offer, but not all people. I have been to Romani festivals etc. and they have lots of good things to offer, you are just a bigot. \n\n\nWho are you asking your loaded questions? From your self? Where all your hate, stupidity and<b>  racism</b> come from? Do you have some kind of self-esteem problem when you must hate people as a group? Don't you know that only idiots do so?

I agree that their culture is a problem, but whenever I see some dumbass overlooking the fact that a lot of them have integrated and try to pile them with these slum dwellers, I can't help but call out how pathetic they are.\n\n\nAlso Europe is multiethnic. In fact, Europe is perhaps the most multiethnic continent on the entire world. I have multiple ethnicities in my country alone for centuries: Bulgarians, Serbians, Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Hungarians. And we're doing just fine.",

I like the history of the U.S.S.R and you are giving us an inside look at the lives of <b> common </b>people living in areas for the former Soviet Union that we would not normally be exposed to.  I recently read a story about the subway system in Tashkent, Uzbekistan which features architecture started while the city was under Soviet control.  No pictures were allowed to be taken of the stations or trains until 2018 because the subway was used as a nuclear bomb shelter and the government didn't want it exposed to the outside world.  The few pictures I have seen are wonderful.  If your travels take you into Uzbekistan I think this would make a very interesting to see and maybe hear from locals about the city and its history.  Thanks and keep up the travels and videos.",

Sometimes it bothers me to see how people consider them not equal, they don't show them politeness required for a formal meeting with strangers.\nOn the other hand, the vast majority of them is burden to society- they steal, they take advantage of benefits as much as it gets (they pretend to <b> disabled,</b> they let their grandparents to formally adopt their child to get money...). I think some of them understand the benefits legislation better then lawyers do \ud83d\ude00 \nPeople call them lazy, but they can be hardworking when they see immediate profit of their work.\nI hope you felt welcome in Slovakia.",

The first is that he's fucking huge, mugging someone big, loud and confident, is far more daunting than mugging someone scared, small and easy to target. The second is that his social intelligence is ridiculous, he goes to these places, is very charming, very flexible, very accommodating, and learns to read people quickly, meaning within five minutes he has usually made multiple friends, you're far more likely to get shit if you're an isolated outsider, than if you quickly integrate yourself and make friends.",

You need to be aware of the circumstances. I would guess they had a contact who \"watched their back\" or made some arrangements. I don't mean it as hate, it's just reality. \n\nIt's also necessary to understand, that most of these people get treated as 2nd class citizens, they live in a cultural echo chamber, they have no means of getting wealthy or having a decent income, they lack a decent education, they lack a healthy support system, have subpar healthcare/mental healthcare etc etc. Imagine living like that, and what it'd do to your view on the rest of the world. You can check how the lonely guys and gals in richer countries are behaving, right here on the internet.\n\nAnd to all of you wannabe far-right/far-left parrots: These people need and deserve assistance, just like everyone who is struggling, but you can't be naive and think that praising their backwards ways and giving them stuff for free is going to change anything.",

They can join any university and get up to Phd level for free, without ever having to pay a cent. They are encouraged to go to school and kids that go to school receive a monetary allowance from the state. There are numerous financial and social benefits they receive. But most decide it's better to live off welfare and do petty crimes on the side. The generous welfare state in Europe sends you more and more money the more children you make. If you have 4-5 children in your care and no official income, you can receive the equivalent of a full time paycheck in welfare without doing anything. Help is plentiful, what they need to do is help themselves. I know because my mother comes from a <b> gypsy </b>family and grew up in such a ghetto. In my experience, people are quite accepting here in Eastern Europe and as long as you follow an education, act like a civilized and decent person, dress cleanly and take care of yourself,<b>  nobody</b> will attack you or disrespect you, or even treat you as an outsider just because your skin is a little browner than normal.",

            "commentText": "The antiziganism movement in Eastern and Central Europe was repelled in the early 1930s for being inhuman and oftenly being associated with anti-semitism, then communists came, they were offered housing, jobs and were integrated into the society, after the fall of communism, they blamed Eastern Europe for the <b> gypsy </b>problem \u2014 Lunik 9's situation can easily be compared to the<b>  gypsy</b> neighborhood Ferentari in the Romania's capital Bucharest. It's not that the authorities are not trying their best, it's just that this is their way of living. They throw waste out of windows, the sanitary teams come and clean the place, just to confront the same issue few days after. They're uneducated, not because the government is not offering them free education (education is free in Romania), but because they prefer to commit theft at an earl<b> y ag</b>e and if caught in a western country (ie Italy) they're incarcerated in hotel-like conditions and just forced to go to school. Don't let the environment they live in fool you, they're not poor \u2014 beggers make more than \u20ac100 a day, not to mention the shoplifting from the high-end shopping outlets or the pick-pocketing. Stop blaming governments for your people's way of living and more importantly stop describing yourself as Romanian, Slovakian, Hungarian or Bulgarian, describe yourself as bei<b> ng gyp</b>sy and stop denigrating the Eastern and Central Europe countries.",

They steal, smell like shit and piss mixed together, don't work, pollute the city and environment, reproduce to have more kids to get more money from the state... Honestly I'm surprised that boy knows to speak English, but they have their cousins in UK siphoning money from your country as well sadly, so... but anyway thanks for showing me how it looks like there :) I think you're the first one to make a video of this quality about Lunik 9 :) I can only encourage you to visit a better side of Slovakia like High Tatras or Slovak Paradise",

Why they continue with their traditions and behaviour and all that? because the Europeans don't accept them. they don't know any other way of rebellion and all they want is to survive.

This is their way, it's what they do, what they've done, and what they will do, always and forever. They will never change, it's a part of their culture for centuries. How come every<b>  gypsy</b> in the world is the same, in every country? They are born in completely different parts of the world, in different times, in a different environment and they are still the same. It's a mystery really...Even the bes<b> t gyps</b>y in the world is still<b>  a gyp</b>sy and you can see it in their charact<b> er. Nob</b>ody treats them badly anymore, they are very spoiled and they get all the help they can but it's no use. People who do treat them badly are doing it because they are acting badly. But no matter how they are treated, it runs in their blood and they can't hide it. If you grew up knowing gypsies, you can always sense them from miles away. They don't even need the dark skin color, it's their mentality. For exam<b> ple, b</b>lack people from UK are different<b>  from </b>black people in Belgium (both in Europe). Also there's a big difference between Am<b> erican</b> black people and others. Not to mention the biggest difference <b> between </b<b> >Afric</b>an black people and othe<b> rs. Bu</b>t a gypsy is always the same wherever he is. If you send <b> one si</b>ngle gypsy alone to Mars, firstly he would demand a very low price for him. Then he would find a way to produce 6 children, 2 mothers and one half sister-half wife. You would be able to see the trash on Martian ground from Earth, he would trade all the equipment for golden necklaces, chains and bracelets. He would destroy the space shuttle and take everything made of copper.",

Few weeks ago city was cleaning another location which was destroyed by them. In only a few years they produced over 200tons of garbage there. And it wasn't such big like Lunik, only a few houses (previously people used to have small gardens and cottages there). Yes, they are poor and it's a pity, that we can't change that situation, but most of them is not able to change it, they don't want to. And yes there are also drugs, raping, they are stealing. I don't say that everyone of them, but unlucky I have to say most of them. 3-4yo kids with toluen are daily near to the main railway station, they are vulgar, they want money and when you say no, they are spiting on you and so on until you show them, that you are stronger, higher, and they have to pay attention about what they are doing. \nSorry about my broken English. \nGood luck.\nP.S. I want to see another video in two month without all that stinking stuff under they windows :) maybe you are a really nice guy who solved one of them problem, or they were just lying like always.

My point is I think I would be \"jolly and happy\" too if I could get up when I wanted, drink vodka or beer all day, have sod all responsibilities and have an apartment given to me. I know it's sad that children have to grow up in slums like that, but the sad fact is that there will ALWAYS be children, and it seems to me to be an equally sad fact that the ones who can't afford any children are the ones who have the most children.",

So how exactly those people earn the money for gold watches, flatscreens, and hifi? They've been given a chance, to live like civilized people. It's not poverty, it's a conscious choice. They chose devastation, living on a pile of rubbish like rats. Stealing, drugs, kidnapping and all that nice stuff. Disgusting.",

In 1996 city council decided to put there almost all Roma people from city there and this is the result. They destroyed many of the blocks (few years ago some of them had to be tear down because of bad static).

Its pitty you don`t show normal Slovakia firtst and then these slums. I`m from Presov, 30km from Kosice and I`ve never been in Lunix IX but we have gipsies here too, a lot of them living in smaller slums in smaller towns everywhere here in eastern Slovakia. Gipsies are problem here and a lot of politicians were trying to solve this problem but it could not be solved that easy. If you live here you would know that 80% of gipsies from slums here live just from social money. They dont care about their kids, they dont pay taxes, rent etc. Goverment build them houses to live. They destroyed them because they hate government.  Normal family here must take loans for 20years!  to build a house or to have a flat.   They are looking into garbages everywhere around the city. A lot of them are in jail or are trying to steal something. Few of them are trying to get socialized, get jobs and live normal life.  But the problem is their mentality. Even if you hire them, they will not do their jobs for 100%. They will not be happy to have a job. I havent seen gipsy that was happy to have a job here and to be thaknful for that.  They want quick money. Most of them are working as construction workers or in waste companies but they really don`t do their jobs very well. This is problem that normal companies are hiring them only as last option... By the way I hope you will not get Hepatitis B. You and the <b> chick </b>should check yourself at a doctor after visit to these slums.",

But I still remember how quick my attitudes changed when I had to move from a \"nice\" neighbourhood to not \"nice\" neighbourhood. You get worn down after a while, when all the people you spend time with don't care about rubbish. \n\nI still remember going into a friends house and the floor in everyroom was covered in trash, the dishes pilled up high and unwashed. It just seemed so normal at the time. \n\nPeople would throw trash on the street and not care. Its a kind of hopelessness I don't know how to explain but everyone feels it and it just seems like lifes not getting any better so whats the point trying.\n\n Lovely video by the way I remember people seeing all the bad things and assuming that only bad people lived in my neibourhood. Its lovely to see someone highlighting the humanity of the people there.",

Although originally built for 2,500 inhabitants, it is estimated that the population is now three times larger. Living standards are low, with services such as gas, water, and electricity cut off, as the majority of inhabitants are not paying rent or utilities fees.\n\n\nHealth standards are low and diseases such as hepatitis, head lice, diarrhea, scabies, and meningitis are <b> common.</b> Unemployment in the borough reaches almost 100 percent. The borough has one elementary school and a kindergarten.\n\n\nLun\u00edk IX is serviced by a bus line, which stops only on selected bus stops. Boarding the bus is only allowed through the front door. Due to frequent attacks of aggressive residents, bus drivers deployed on the line receive a hazard pay.",

However bad it may look, the situation is getting better. Their mayor is a smart guy with a university degree and does everything he can to improve things. The crime rate decreased substantially, many people are getting new flats and they are working on taking away the garbage.\n\n\nBy the way, if you want a really horrific experience, you should go to<b>  gypsy</b> settlements at Svinia, Secovce, Trebisov or Chminianske Jakubovany. I've never seen things as terrible as there. You're basically crawling through human feces, 6 year olds are doing drugs in front of you, there are dead dogs rotting on piles of garbage etc. It's a very sad side of Slovakia and it's extremely difficult to find a solution to th<b> e gyps</b>y problem.\n\n\nGreat video as always by the way;)",

Some data from Metapedia's Gypsies article..:\n\nSeveral studies of the IQ of Gypsies have found average IQs ranging from 70 to 83.[9]\r\n\r\nThe average IQs of Gypsies in different countries have been stated to be 85 in Slovenia, 83 in Slovakia, 70 in Serbia, and 60 in Romania.[7]\r\n\r\nA 2015 meta-analysis stated an average IQ of 74.[10]\r\n\r\nDuring a Slovak study in the 90s, 23 510 children in the <b> age </b>of 6 \u2013 14 years in the district of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Slovakia, were given a Wechsler Scale test. A total of 510 children (2,16 %) were diagnosed as mentally retarded (with an IQ 70 or less). 0,9 % of the non-Gypsies were diagnosed as mentally retarded, as opposed to 21,5 % Gypsies. Although the<b>  Gypsy</b> children constituted only 6 % of the testing sample, they counted for 60,7 % of the mentally retarded. [11]\n\nMany attempts to improve the living conditions and/or integrate the Gypsies into the larger society has been tried. Sometimes these attempts have involved the use of force in order to settle down, educate, and assimilate the Gypsies. All such attempt have been stated to have been without success.[7]\n\nIn Central and South-Eastern Europe, an average of 46.8 percent of Roma families receive social assistance; 56.8 percent receive child support payments. In Bulgaria, 90% live on state benefits. In Britain, their \"skillful manipulation of [the] benefits system has brought an outcry from the media, police, and charities for the homeless.\"[7]\r\n\r\nOne reason for migration to Western Europe has been stated to be much more beneficial welfare systems.[17][18]\n\nTh<b> e Gyps</b>y population continues to grow rapidl<b> y. Gyp</b>sy girls traditionally marry between the ages of 14 and 17. Fertility is high: 3.0 children <b> per wo</b>man in Bulgaria, 3.03 in Serbia, 3.12 in Hungary, 3.2 in Bratislava, 3.3 to 3.7 for 'some' groups in Romania, 3.9 in Croatia, and 4.3 in Eastern Slovakia. This can be compared with 1.1 and 1.4 children<b>  per w</b>oman by 2000 in f<b> ormer Comm</b>unist countries.[7]",

Ended up booking a cheap spontaneous flight to Ko\u0161ice and went there last week, not knowing much about Slovakia at all. We got a tour \u2018authentic Ko\u0161ice' which was a fascinating insight into the area's raw past and struggle with Soviet occupation, as well as showing us an abandoned factory and bunker. On our tour in a 1985 Skoda (which we were allowed to drive) we passed through Lunik 9. It was like a warzone, and t left a huge impression upon us. Hot water and electricity was turned off by the council, people were throwing sewage off their balconies with children running around. As we turn the corner a gang of men were out in the street and stuck their fingers up at our car as it went by, basically saying a big \u2018fuck you' to tourists. It was quite dangerous - if our car stopped we would've been battered alive! I actually filmed a video of this myself to get my own blogging/documentary making going which I need to edit. Then I get back home and load up YouTube and what do I see a week later - mr<b>  bald</b> has done a video here! Unbelievable, I cannot believe how much balls this guy has to come here. Despite what he says it was dangerous as hell, and we blended in with our really shit car. Legitimately this man is risking his life to show us how people live around the world in places which escape western media attention. A massive hats off to this video and I'm also low-key gutted I didn't see M<b> r Bal</b>d out there!",

I walked around the streets through several areas of Kosice and not once did I feel any danger. Slovakia is in the EU so it isn't so bad. I didn't meet any gypsies when I was there.",

Immediately when they will see you're coming towards them with a camera, they will start throwing rocks and come on you with axes and bats.

Clearly the social welfare the state gives them is squandered on drugs and <b> alcohol.</b> I hear disease is rampant too. Never catch me there...  \"They make the most of terrible situation\"...a situation they created.",

But you have one mistake in your translate: when you asked if their kids have any chance to live outside of Lunik IX, the man said \"<b> zero\"</b>, but<b>  woman</b> said \"they could have\". So there is not as much pessimism.\nI was there too when i ived in Ko\u0161ice town. Just to observe and see that legendary place with my own eyes, i was little scared but havin<b> g nothin</b>g valuable i h<b> ad nothi</b>ng to lose. They were a bit aggresive but it was just verbal which is no big deal. However i can imagine being beaten up or robbed because as there are many such cases.  \nI know about few settlements that are poorer than this one, but they are located on countryside in eastern part of Slovakia far away from big cities. Anyway Lunik IX looks to be really the biggest \"slum\" in our country.",

Also this roma tribe is world famous for creating garbage and then moving on to the new place, concept of permanent settlements, working hard for better future, do not fall in their dictionary.

But I hope that when These kids grow up, they will become a part of \"normal\" society and live normal life in Kosice and not in this shithole their parents created. Becouse even when the guy in video said they will clean the place in 2 months, i dont really trust him.",

The goal would be to teach them how to manage personal finance and take care of their community? This isint a well thought out idea or plan but what would you add to this idea?",

Spending 2-3 hours in Lunik IX surely is enough to understand how innocent the gypsies are and how all us Slovaks are filthy Nazis for giving up on gypsies. I wonder if you're going to stick around Slovakia for longer so maybe some Slovaks could tell you how it really is living 24/7 in a Slovak town terrorised by gangs o<b> f gyps</b>y kids, teens, women and men all and any of them, the robberies, the killings of grannies for 10 euros, the torturing of pets <b> by gyp</b>sy kids, the beating of rail conductors and passengers on trains, the slicing of young men's head with an axe for telling drunk gypsies off, and much more terror every day throughout central and eastern Slovakia. But surely a lifetime experience of Slovak people with gypsies<b>  is noth</b>ing compare to the 2 hours of a British guy seeing smiling kids in a city block with brand new cctv installed and police station just stones throw away. This image you made in your head during the short visit is definitely the accurate picture of the situation, come on give your head a shake.",

The people who built these buildings knew perfectly well with no budget for maintenance these places would turn into shit-holes. It's a crime to turn over property like this with no plan on how to maintain it. If there's no budget for maintenance a place will turn into a shit-hole, no matter where it's located. Budgets include wages for general maintenance workers, as well as plumbers, electricians, painters, etc.,etc., and materials, spare parts and so on. It costs a lot of money to maintain a high rise building. What did the Gov't expect? To me this project looks like an expensive exercise in making Roma people look bad. Congratulations, Slovakia, it worked. Now what?",

But those East European gipsy are a different culture. When Bulgaria and Romania became Schengen-states, many came to Western Europe. Here in the neighbouring town of Duisburg they rented whole houses. In no time they looked like Lunik IX. I remember a live reporter on TV, when during he was speaking a window opened and the shell of a water melon flew out of the window just on the street. That does not work, and that makes it very difficult for us to accept them as they are. But again: They are not all like this! Most have normal jobs and normal homes, and  only sometimes you can hear it from the family-name that their ancestors were gipsy.",

The government wanted to help them so they built a block of flats for them to live in but now that block looks pretty much identical to this place. In the documentary they even admit that their living conditions are their own doing. It's not <b> racism </b>or<b>  xenophobia</b> that have them living there, it's their own laziness.\n\nThere have been a ton of programs, both government, NGOs and EU to \"help\" these people bu<b> t nothin</b>g has worked. These people know that if they just stay put some bleeding heart leftist will come running with a fist full of cash to hand them.\n\nThese people don't need another program, they need a kick up the ass",

The government does <b> nothing </b>in fear of being perceived as<b>  racist</b> (as well as the issue seemingly being unsolvable without radical solutions) but keeps being their ATM to further enable this. \n\nState gives parents plenty of money to ensure their kids can go to school, but when they pocket the money instead of buying school supplies, meals and clothes, attack the buses which would take the kids to school and then decry the school/state for being tyrannical and genocidial when they try to enforce regular school attendance and taxes/bill payments and basic security then you lose any sympathy you'd have for them pretty damn quick.",

It's mindblowing that after hundreds of years in Europe the Romani people have not managed to change and adapt more over time, and we see people living in ghettos like his in 2019. The problem seems overwhelming. Is it a possibility to try avoid such large ghettos like this, but more relocate people to smaller settlements, well apart from each other, where it might be easier to 'pull' more of the young generation out of the 'bad circle'?

First of all you must go to the roots with tons of resources (in the right way, not benefits for example) over at least two generations. You realize that even if they get school, their socioeconomic situation doesn't just go away? They still live in the neighborhood you saw. You wouldn't last a day there. So saying they are pouring resources is laughable. Give them the homes and lives of the middle class and we will see how they behave. \n\nIt is like the father complex. One seek to what is comfortable and normal, even if it means robbing and acting bad. They need outside influx too for rolemodels and integrating a new way of living. They don't know how to act normal in our sense. That is why it is so dangerous and bad once a culture is inflicted with poverty and such.",

For instance, not many people know that the last prisoner to leave a French concentration camp was a Rom. He left it almost a year after the end of the war, in 1946...\nIndeed, the idea of Lunik IX was an excellent one: to house a mix population of Slovaks (Roms, military and police staffs) but the military and police staffs refused to move in, they didn't want to live with the Roms. If they had move in, you can imagine how the situation would have been different. The present residents aren't fully responsible for the bad condition of the area. The owner of the building is responsible for the maintenance and it looks like <b> nothing </b>has been done for decades.\nWhen I was a kid, in the Parisian suburbs, the building where I lived was in bad condition too (not as Lunik IX). The paint, door-frames, electric system,<b>  old</b> elevators, etc. gave a slum-like feeling because they were simply unmaintained by the government who didn't want to spend money for immigrants. Among other consequences, the resident didn't take care of anything. During the nineties, after twenty-five years of neglected state, the government financed a global and huge renovation plan. The building became clean and practical, with reliable elevators, entry phones, new bathrooms, etc. Since the renovation, the residents respect the shared areas and they keep the place clean.",

For what I know, the city of Ko\u0161ice first decided to house any type of non-Romani population (we now know they didn't come from Egypt so we could stop calling them \"Gypsies\"; and \"White\" doesn't mean anything either) but since <b> nobody </b>wanted to live near the Roms, they then started to house only problematic non-Romani populations (dodgers, maladjusted and squatters from other parts of the city). Which means they sent people with problems to live with people who already had their own problems. As you may know, by mixing social groups you can sometimes reduce problematic attitudes. A few countries excel in doing this, many don't or give up because it involves a complicated management.",

Not only do they keep the inside of their own homes very tidy, they clean the hallways, wash the pavement, etc. No one is throwing rubbish out their windows. No one would even think of covering the walls of their own buildings with graffiti. \n\nThat Roma fella was upfront about it. We made this mess, and we have to clean it.

There were more apartment buildings in this quarter but the tenants gradually destroyed it to such extent, that they were no longer habitable and were pulled down. Increasing of debts for utilities among so many tenants resulted in shutting it down for whole apartment buildings.",

The idea was to integrate (yet another of countless attempts to do so) <b> gypsy </b>minority into majority society by making them live in a fairly high class neighborhood settled by people who would serve as an example of someone living by rules. Basically mostly police officers, army officers and their families and gypsies lived there. It failed spectacularly. Everyone who could (including already integrated gypsies) moved out after the fall of socialism when the state stopped dictating who lives where. It took gypsies less than a decade since fall of the iron curtain to transform wealthy neighborhood with brand new residential building to this. Barely anyone pays rent and buildings are beyond repair which means when they finally reach the threshold of being dangerous to live in, the city have to demolish them because gypsies would settle them illegally with no thought about safety.",

Thats why they do a lot of bad things and are uncivilised and they dont have any respect for the law or anything. Not to mention that in any country they are, they make a bad reputation for Romania and that really piss me off, because I am not a<b>  gypsy</b> and I dont want to be treated like a thief , like a paria in other country from the EU or anywhere in the world where they do bad things. France, Germany, Great Britain and other civilised countries from Europe keep telling Romania \"Oh, you dont support them, they need to be respected, integrated, etc...\" but when this gypsies are in their countries they want them out as soon is possible :)) Hypocrisy at its finest!",

As you can see even at Lunik IX, you can find people who live decently, like that family with beautiful flat even in Lunik IX. BUT Europeans did not marginalize them. They marginalized themselves. Whatever they did get from state, they destroyed - the flats at Lunik IX is clear example. They even admitted that all that rubbish was made by themselves, there are dustbins, they just do not use them. And in whatever conditions you live, how is it possible that you let your kids drink<b>  alcohol</b> in such youn<b> g ag</b>e? and then the parents just say that there <b> is ze</b>ro chance for better life of their children ?!?! Just to be clear, your video is interesting and I agree with many comments below that you were able to show people something that even journalists were not able to do. I am from Slovakia and I live in a village who has a problem with Roma population, so I know something about it. But for those who never really had this experience I just wanna say that those news in media like \"Slovakia/EU marginalize Roma population\" drives me mad, because most of their problems are caused by themselves. And of course you do not think they are dangerous, but you should ask postmen or social workers how agressively these people can behave when they are visited.",

            "commentText": "A Ko\u0161ice native here. Seeing what has been going on in Lunik IX is indeed very sad. Unfortunately, it's not going to get any better (no simple solutions here). There are several reasons for this and both the Roma and the whites (the local Slovaks and Hungarians) are responsible (to various extents). \n\n\nChildren growing up there see their parents being trapped in a vicious circle of poverty (unemployment in the borough reaches 100%) and drug addiction, and the kids themselves often struggle with drugs from a very young <b> age </b>(it is not uncommon to see Roma kids as young as 8 years inhaling solvents). The kids often don't go to schools (even though it's mandatory and free) and thus grow up illiterate. They consider this lifestyle acceptable because they simply don't know any better.\nT\nhe way the whites are responsible for this is the prejudice against the Roma and turning a<b>  blind</b> eye on what's been going on there. If you're that extraordinary 1 in 1,000 who is capable of \"escaping\" but are treated like shit by the majority, then good luck.\n\n\n30 years ago, after the fall of the previous regime, everybody had more-or-less the same starting position (or was equally poor as I like to put it). The same endowment, education, dwellings, healthcare... everything. How did we get where we are right now? My only explanation is a different temperament of the Roma. While you cannot generalise, they've always struck me as a slipshod and happy-go-lucky bunch. They've been in Europe for more than 3 centuries and still haven't integrated. \n\n\nCurrently, the far-right is polling at around 10% and the majority of what they talk about revolves around the Roma. The fertility rates vary greatly between the whites (at around 1.4) and the Roma (my conservative estimate would be 5.0+), which only further exacerbates the tensions. In my opinion, the best solution would be a very strict child welfare service in Slovakia, not unlike the \"Barnevernet\" in Norway. But I'm not convinced even this would help.",

Indus valley civilization (2000bc): 2000 year before christ born when whole Europe was in stone <b> age.</b> There were cities in India(specifically in places frm where gypsies are) with brick walls, multistory houses, covered drainage system. So, it shows that culture is not here to blame.\n2. There r many Indians migrated to Malaysia, Singapore etc and they r among the most educated, financially secure there.\n3. Now come to modern migration. There r many<b>  Indian</b> migrated to US, EU in Modern time. They r also educated, modern.\nSo, india is dirty not because of culture but because of poverty. It takes a lot money to build and maintain sewage plants, garbage collection. Even rich countries like UK, Canada find it tough to manage garbage. That's why either theydump it in ocean or export it to Asian countries like China, Philippines.",

I still have hope that even Lunik IX can once be \"normal\" district. Our government made mistakes in the past, that they gave those flats \"for free\" to asocial kind of people who lived basically in slums like you showed at the end of video. With no social workers to help them integrate, it couldnt end up any different way. I wonder if they also showed you \"new\" house which was built there like 2-3 years ago and its still in very good shape. Gypsies who lwanted to live there had to have a job, send kids to school and obvieously they have to pay rent and dont throw a trash everywhere. Thats the way to do it. They want to expand this project in near future. Hopefully it will finally work and this place will start to change. Hopefully more videos are coming from Kosice or Slovakia? :)",

I doubt it that Irish Travelers leave everything tidy before they move their caravans. Some council estates in England look very similar with Lunik 5. The only thing that makes them different that council still comes to pick up the trash they leave behind. But if you notice in the Video, despite all that mess from outside, houses inside (as<b>  Bald</b> says it himself) look a lot cleaner than any average British full time proud mummy of 6 with 6 different dads house given for free by the council. Ever<b> y natio</b>n has their own bad eggs. Let's not blame it on gypsies only. UKs benefits system is fucked up already. And most of those on benefits are smack heads and whores, not foreigners.",

However, I'm deeply offended by your reference of Calcutta which you used as a benchmark. Calcutta is the cultural capital of India and one of the fastest growing cities of India. Tall skyscrapers, shopping malls, new metro lines are being built in the city and yet westerners still associate this city with poverty just because Mother Teresa started her operations in the city. Even today, western media tries to highlight poverty in India without showing the economic progress. Unfortunately, you have also fallen victim to this western stereotype.",

All left except for the Roma. I think these \"blocks of flats - \u010din\u017eiaky\" as we call them were destroyed within three years. You can't say its safe just because you paid a visit; they treat you nicely of course, as a guest. It would be different if you stayed longer. From time to time I can see kids doing drugs, which is inhaling thinners here.\nThe small kids know some English because some of their relatives left for UK.",

            "commentText": "The traditional Romanies place a high value on the\u00a0extended family.\u00a0Virginity\u00a0is essential in unmarried women. Both men and women often marry young; there has been controversy in several countries over the Romani practice of\u00a0child marriage. Romani law establishes that the man's family must pay a\u00a0bride price\u00a0to the bride's parents, but only traditional families still follow this rule.\n\nOnce married, the <b> woman </b>joins the husband's family, where her main job is to tend to her husband's and her children's needs, as well as to take care of her in-laws. The power structure in the traditional Romani household has at its top the oldest man or grandfather, and men in general have more authority than women. Women gain respect and authority as they get older. Young wives begin gaining authority once they have children.\n\nRomani\u00a0social behavior\u00a0is strictly regulated by\u00a0Hindu\u00a0purity laws[187]\u00a0(\"marime\" or \"marhime\"), still respected by most Roma (and by most older generations of\u00a0Sinti). This regulation affects many aspects of life, and is applied to actions, people and things: parts of\u00a0the human body\u00a0are considered impure: the\u00a0genital organs\u00a0(because they produce emissions), as well as the rest of the lower body. Clothes for the lower body, as well as the clothes of\u00a0menstruating\u00a0women, are washed separately. Items used for eating are also washed in a different place. Childbirth is considered impure, and must occur outside the dwelling place. The mother is considered impure for forty days after giving birth.\n\nDeath is considered impure, and affects the whole family of the dead, who remain impure for a period of time. In contrast to the practice of\u00a0cremating\u00a0the dead, Romani dead must be buried.[188]\u00a0Cremation and burial are both known from the time of the\u00a0Rigveda, and both are widely practiced in\u00a0Hinduism\u00a0today (although the tendency is for Hindus to practice cremation, while some communities in South India tend to bury their dead).[189]Some animals are also considered impure, for instance cats because they lick their hindquarters. Horses, in contrast, are not considered impure because they cannot do so.[190]\n\nBelonging and exclusionEdit\n\nMain articles:\u00a0Romanipen\u00a0and\u00a0Gadjo (non-Romani)\n\nIn Romani philosophy,\u00a0Romanipen\u00a0(also\u00a0romanypen,\u00a0romanipe,\u00a0romanype,\u00a0romanimos,\u00a0romaimos,\u00a0romaniya) is the totality of the Romani spirit,\u00a0Romani culture,\u00a0Romani Law, being a Romani, a set of Romani strains.\n\nAn<b>  ethnic</b> Romani is considered a\u00a0gadjo\u00a0in the Romani society if he has no Romanipen. Sometimes a non-Romani may be considered a Romani if he has Romanipen. Usually this is an adopted child. It has been hypothesized that it owes more to a\u00a0framework of culturerather than simply a",

They stick together, keep their traditions - good and bad ones too - , and are resistant to change that's coming from the outside.\n For example, they don't say \"cousin\", but they consider them sisters/brothers too, even very distant family members. Even if somebody moves out from the family home, they still live 5-10 minutes apart and they still spend most of the day together. \nThey consider their friends family members. So if you're friends with one, you're friends with every one of them. If you don't know one, well, they won't be aggressive if you don't show fear, this is the reason why Ben was welcomed there. And yeah, the truth is they are not really poor, but they spend their money on drugs most of the time, be it<b>  alcohol</b>, meth, weed, or on just pointless stuff like expensive clothing, cars, etc. When they steal, they do it because they need money for drugs, like 90% of the time.",

Another thing what Orban is messing up is the public education(not only for the romani people, but good teachers go to schools where the students are mostly hungarian so they don't have to deal with the problems which are made by the mentality of the parents of those kids) But gypsies who are well integrated, are facing less discrimination today then they did like 15yrs ago(probably has <b> nothing </b>to do with Orban, hungarians probably just regonised ,that well integrated romas can't do anything about many romas being antisocial)",

Even in middle class Queens, NY, the kids are anxious about their futures and some do drugs, more drink, some starve themselves hoping to escape through fashion/entertainment and some study their brains out, a few committing suicide when they don't get perfect scores on everything.  There's work and there are good, fairly affordable schools here, but not enough and our federal government wants to pull support from everything.  This is a city in which the middle class contains a lot of civil servants - bus drivers, sanitation workers, police, firefighters, teachers, etc. We don't make a lot of things here -- Wall Street  doesn't make, it invests and trades in things that don't create jobs right in NY. Service industry jobs have the lowest salaries, so even if people buy things or eat at restaurants, that's not building anyone's future except the owners. There's a limit to how many of these businesses can survive, as well. In our nicest neighborhoods the turnover of storefronts is incredible. Rents drive good businesses out as well as lack of customers. My point is, my students are frustrated and scared and sometimes self-destructive. What must it be like to be inside these kids' heads? We are not all entrepreneurs. Some very good people excel at helping others, being part of a larger effort, organizing, assisting -- driving a bus, teaching a class, etc. But if there is no public transportation, schools aren't valued, there's not even garbage pickup? Ok these people made a mess. How much garbage do the fraternities in my city strew into the streets? So we put all of garbage in neat little bags -- about 50 of them on weekends in back of the building I live in. The gypsies probably also should have been allowed to live how they wanted -- you can't just take people and throw them into something without help. But I bet they cleaned their camps before they left. Either way, not all those little kids are going to be Elon Musk. What life is being offered to any kids in that region? The economy is struggling in most of these towns.",

            "commentText": "I read that these buildings are being torn down one by one as they continue to decay. Most of the people are far in arrears on their rents, there are a lot of squatters living there illegally, and most have their utilities shut off due to non-payment. Unemployment hovers near 100%. This is one of the consequences of the fall of the Soviet Union, not that the Soviet Union was a good thing but it left many of the smaller and less well off republics with infrastructure, institutions, and social welfare programs that they could no longer afford to maintain without subsidies from Moscow so they had to be shut down or scaled back tremendously. You see this repeated throughout many of Bald's videos when he travels to some of the most remote reaches of the former USSR and it's satellite states. Even within some of the better off republics like Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and others there are parts of those countries where whole villages and towns are gradually disappearing because people can't make a living in those places anymore and city life is much more attractive than digging potatoes and turnips and dying poor like your ancestors did for hundreds of years. Some of the older people who have never known anything else remain in those places but as soon as a young person finds a way out of that life, they take it and leave and the village dies when it's elders do.",

As of 2011 people at Lunik 9 had debt 6,3 million \u20ac for energy and garbage probably even more nowadays. Those families who were paying were moved from there at their own request to new housing. Until 2014 city had to demolish 6 blocks because they were such heavily destroyed by tenants that building statics no longer safe. And one more the bus drivers who driver there has risk premium for driving there.",

Cities with more of an <b> old </b>town feel but stunning architecture includes Komarno (altough the majority of people there speak Hungarian) Banska Bystrica in the heart of Slovakia has a very beautiful city center. Just have to look outside of the capital city sometimes' tourists get really drawn into Bratislava, but personally, there is a lot more to Slovakia, and I lived in Bratislava for some time.  Slovakia is a hidden treasure.  Cheers!",

I live in Bratislava (the capital of Slovakia) so the west Slovakia where we live really good if you compare it to the east part. I know many people that come from the east and they have many good and also bad experiences with gypsies... We tend to close our eyes at this \"problem\" because it is easier to just pretend it is not happening this type of segregation. It is also the reason why the man said they were living in Dublin. There he could make some money for the family... So is there a way out of it? Yes, but it would take too much time and our politicians don't want to, cause they don't care for something after they get replaced for another politician... Really a vicious circle.\nBut I like you have some balls of steel and Alinchek has a really nice czech/slovak. I ship you",

It's located in the Czech Republic and it looked exactly the same, but they tried to clean it up and renovate it. So there is hope for Lunik 9 I guess.\nAnyways, I love your vids. Keep up the good work and be safe on your travellings. \nGreeting from Czech Rep!",

We had couple of gypsies in classroom in elementary school. I meet <b> gypsy </b>people almost every day in my hometown Kosice. All kinds of them. There are asocial gypsies who failed to integrate, they live in slums in many Eastern Slovak villages, they dont work and dont know any better. Then there are gypsies who live like normal people. Go to work, kids go to school... They might have more temperament in general, but they are valuable part of society. PRoblem with gypsies is largely historical issue which I believe can be fixed. Because we have some positive examples where integration worked pretty well. Take village Spissky Hrhov as one example. Google it, I believe you will find about it something in english too.",

Many gypsy-defenders from the West went there and said \"<b> nobody </b>robbed me, they are good people, Bulgaria is<b>  racist</b>\", but when you live here you see their real side. I know there are some, that are intelligent, but mostly they walk on gangs and then it's dangerous. Most of the cases of robbery are from gypsies.\nGypsies also influence our culture very badly, which brings negative points against them too.  Most gypsies have very bad character, they are very likely to lie. They have a really big problem integrating their culture into European.\nP.S: When are you going to come here? If there isn't anybody who offered you, I can tell you where to go? :\u0414",

Could've been more specific but that's generally understood as the speech patterns of British born, ethnically Jamaican, or more generally Caribbean people. It has obviously spread over to other ethnicities as well. You can now hear anything from whites to South Asian Brits in certain ares of East, or South London (and many others all over Britain) speaking similarly. My point wasn't about knit-picking definitions though. I was just wondering how some kids from a segregated <b> gypsy </b>neighbourhood in Slovakia picked it up, to the point where both the accent and jargon are on point?  Surely, it must come from significant exposure to people with those accents, rather than just watching a few grime videos on youtube. Surprised<b>  bald</b> and bankrupt didn't investigate...",

The smell is really is quite something, and the second time I went there, I had to leave due to them throwing rocks and firecrackers at my car for some reason. It was interesting to see the inside perspective and that they admit they're at fault for the issues at Lunik 9.\n\nI'm a Brit expat who lived in Estonia for 9 years and has spent the majority of the last few years driving around the ex-USSR and Yugoslav regions, you'll often find gypsies will blame everyone else for their problems and try to pretend they've repaired them and the government didn't care.",

Them forming begging/scam rings is also not uncommon despite them not generally being violent, although it only is a minority who does it it still sucks when they're the prominent ones.\n\n\nI appreciate  that for hundreds of years they were repressed and marginalized, but that was mainly because of their stubborn refusal to integrate, which you can still see to this day, even in this video, they keep claiming to be slovak, but how many Slovaks do you see living in ghettos, polluting everywhere and leeching water, electricity and internet/tv? Even the poor <b> elderly </b>in forgotten villages who struggle to live and have every reason to not give a shit about a country that abandoned them don't behave this way.",

I suppose by European standards they're substandard, but home is what you make of it. Displaced communities often have issues, but the fact that people are still smiling and kids are relatively healthy means they're still eeking out a life there. Much love and luck to them that they can clean up and improve their lives.",

Those buildings were brand new when they got them for free, but they destroyed everything, burned the wooden floors as a form of heating. There is even a word in Czech language \"vybydlet\", which is hard to translate, but it was created to describe what gypsies do with brand new (free) flats - They destroy all the furniture, floors, walls, remove radiators and sell them as scrap iron. And then some non-government organization blames the government for inhumane conditions they live in, government caves in again and they get new apartments to be completely destroyed for free again.

This also resulted in the dumbing down of the once great civilization, which is probably why your country is simply unable to clean up all the trash and make it look at least halfway developed.
