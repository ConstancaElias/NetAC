The Jews are a textbook example of the one trying to blame the many, while those many are blaming the one. The situation itself shows whom is most likely in the wrong, whom is most likely lying about blame.\n\nThe Jews aren't really as they want us to believe. They aren't nearly so innocent, nor harmless, as they proclaim themselves to be via the media organs which they control. And the quickest way for anyone in the media to discredit him-/herself is speak as if that were not the case.",

            "commentText": "Most antisemitism is a rational response to Jewish behavior. Seldom have the Jews suffered undeservingly from antisemitism. That's the truth of the matter, and the ADL can spin its lies however they wish, forever, and it will remain true that the Jews bring about antisemitism by their own actions. They merely whine louder than other groups can because they control most of the mainstream media in North America and in Europe.\n\nIndeed, one of the (legitimate) gripes that the gentiles have with the Jews is that they have been managing the information that becomes available to gentiles by misusing their control of the mainstream media. There's some blow-back to be expected from that, you know. Antisemitic blow-back of a perfectly rational nature.\n\nAnd then there are the banks, the usury practiced upon America by the Federal Reserve System and the (mostly) Jews who run it. And the corruption of American culture, which will also provoke some reactionary and understandable antisemitic feelings.\n\nThe position of the Jews is, really, an irrational one. They actually expect all of the other peoples on Earth to think that the Jews are never, under any circumstances, to have been in the wrong with regard to the dislike that others have for them.\n\nImagine that the teacher of an elementary school classroom comes into the room from the hall and notices that there is a lot of disorderly behavior among her pupils. She asks who is to blame for the trouble. Immediately, every kid in the classroom points at one of the other kids. The same one, who is at the same time trying to shift the blame off of himself to each of the students who are pointing at him. If the teacher is sensible, she will assume, unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, that the many are right and that the one is wrong.\n\nBut the Jews control the media. They have long practice in using those media to push propaganda on the masses, shaping public opinion. They can even promote irrational ways of thinking, of evaluating facts, so that the public will regard the Jews as incapable of being the bad guys. And that is exactly what they have done.\n\nThe public must be de-programmed. Antisemitism, insofar as it is rational, should be de-stigmatized. The fact that many (perhaps most) antisemitic statements are also true statements should become understood and accepted.",

But I haven't forgotten that it was Jews (like Emanuel Celler) who sought and got changes to US immigration laws that essentially opened America's gates to those Muslims. Fox News is okay for some kinds of information, but it is still too favorably disposed toward Jews, to such an extent that it fails to report the harm that Jews have inflicted on American culture and the corruption that Jews have inflicted on American politics -- even as they do precisely those things with regard to Muslims. If we had never had the Jews here, then we'd not be having the Muslims among us now, either.",

They are a bigger threat to Western civilization than people think. \nI know the USA stand with Israel : it is geopolitics. Exactly like with Saudi Arabia. But when moral values  culture and fundamental mentality are on the table,  Westerners have <b> nothing </b>to do with the Jews.\nI will never ever support Muslims and their deadly cult, but I also will never ever trust the Jews. The fact I oppose Islam doesn't automatically lead me to support the Jews : they have deeply overwhelmed Western society through communism an ideology originating in Jewry, and now cultural communism. There is no way I will consider Soros, Madoff, Goldman-Sachs, the  Rothschilds, Barbara Spectre and their fellows as friends, and these are only the tip of the iceberg. \n\nLinda Sarsour and her community are for sure a clear and present danger to America as it is to the whole Western civilization, not to say the whole world. Only leftards could want her to speak on their behalf. Only them hate Western civilization so much they shamelessly shake hands with the Devil. More than Islam which  malicious nature we know,  it is liberals spinelessness that inspires loathing. They too are a direct threat to the West and it is all the most serious by the fact they are generally White Westerners themselves.\n\nPS : calling Linda Sarsour an anti Semite makes no sense : she herself is a Semite. It is like when the left calls Kanye West a White supremacist.",

I am so sorry you are filled with so much hatred for people simply because of the skin they were born in. I'm so sorry you feel that \"white people\" are NAZIS. \n\nAs a white, female conservative born in the 70's in a predominantly white community outside Chicago, I was raised that <b> black </b>is beautiful. In jr. high, every kid is school had pictures of Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston or Prince in their lockers.\n\nIn High School, the \"cool kids\" wore MC Hammer pants, listened to rap. I would go to see movies simply because Eddie Murphy (must of watched Golden Child 100 x's!) Will Smith, Richard Pryor (easily one of the funniest men on Earth, God bless his soul) or Morgan Freeman were in them. (I honestly believe Morgan was in almost EVERY single movie in the 90's & early 2000's! ;)\n\nGrowing up EVERY kid HAD to watch The Cosby Show, A Different World, Different Strokes, 227, Martin, Living Color. I can STILL sing every word to the Jeffersons theme song to this day! Remember how cute Webster was? I do!\n\nI grew up listening to my dad's records of Lena Horn, Nina Simone gives me chills EVERYTIME I hear the soul in her voice. The first song we danced at our wedding was Nat King Cole.\n\nToni Braxton & Seal were a HUGE part of my late teens. Seeing Seal live was one of my all time favorite concerts.\n<b> \nBlack</b> culture to me growing up & now was always the COOL culture<b> - blac</b>k Americans were some of the farthest reaching descendants of o<b> ur Nati</b>on. I raise my OWN children NOW t<b> hat bl</b>ack IS beautiful & to EVER judge someone simply by the color of their skin is ABHORRENT.\n\nI AM in the majority of white people thinking this way. Please do not believe the sensationalized news telling you that white people are white Supremacists. White people are ashamed & EMBARRASSED to have a small hate filled grou<b> p of</b> dim witted, throwbacks to a hate f<b> ille</b>d age associated with them. WE HATE THEM TOO!\n\nGod bless you. I pray you can see thru the hate filled lies CONSTANTLY broadcast to know that the MAJORITY of white people are NOT RACISTS- for whatever reason we're being sold as ones.",

Sarsour must be banned from all American politics. If the left doesn't publically and fully ban her, that would be the absolute testimony for their true nature, for their hypocrisy and double-standard. There is NO PLACE for antisemites in American politics. PERIOD.",

We do have freedom of religion in America,  however,  Now, it appears amazing that we have rules in court house,  supper table, congress and so forth to remove your cowboy hats, ball caps, and such but now exactly how is our OUR SOCIETY supposed to accept and endorse someone sitting in a court room completely covered in a sheet except their eyes and it's not right for someone to remove their Maga cap or Stetson cowboy hat. Really, the point is the everyone wants to come to US but just for the land to abuse, deplete,  take away from and twist up everything we have as \"the norm\". So to me it's not at all the FOREIGNERS appreciate, want or even respect America. It's sad but they just want to WRECK IT. Can we ever find a happy balance living harmoniously amongst each other, accepting different cultures in our society WITHOUT UP ROOTING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  Obviously,  if EVERYONE trying to get in our sovereign <b> nation,</b> we must not have done too bad. True jealousy and covetousness.  But, now it's about mass migration and Turing the entire world in to chaos and conflict UNTIL they manage to get us ALL UNDER CONTROL",

Cortez didn't advocate for open borders, neither did Gillum or ORourke.  I heard one single fool in California say it and I saw a sign from a parade about 20 times.  Immigration is the most obvious donor issue in the country.  The gop held the border patrol budget hostage, almost 20 years ago.  They refuse to pass budget increases without putting permanent ban on amnesty.  That's why an over priced, anti terror unit is doing the job.  I was republican, you just don't know enough to be drawing conclusions.. I want them to bust the people that Hire illegals, if they're working and paying taxes, I don't care about them.  5 people have more money than half the planet and you're still targeting immigrants with over priced, unnecessary, anti terror units.  You built a conspiracy theory, on a strawman, that is targeting the one person that wants to actually end soros's influence by getting money out of politics.  You all cry about msm.... Why isn't trump killing the Klintonian 96 telecommunications act???  The media is consolidated because of the 96 telecommunications act...  why isn't he fixing it?",

The Assyrian sold god's chosen people as slaves and Assyria repopulated the land with migrants and then it was renamed Samaria. This where the legend of the 10 lost tribes comes from.\nAlso note Assyrian Empire  used diversity to  dominate weaker nations. The Jews were just one of 12 tribes, the levitates did not own land and lived as the priests. People\nwith the surnames Cohen means 'priest'  and Levin are Levitates. Gods chosen people close but no cigar. Looks like you need to read your bible more. ;P",

Well known facts with no partisa<b> n slan</b>t whatsoever completely escape you and your incredib<b> ly du</b>mb mind infers that \"it's all lies!\" because you were too clueless and stupid to follow along with the facts as the hillary investigation was going on. Adults are open to information that they weren't aware of before, only trash with the cognitive ability of a toddler automatically takes well known information about hillary's wrongdoings and immediately tries to infer that they're \"lies\". Even most leftists know everything I listed, and some of what I didn't, like her deleting 30,000 additional emails after being told to hand them over, and destroying a bunch of hard drives/\n\nPeople who actually have brains actually read reports and are able to understand what sources are misrepresenting, slanting, or leaving out info, and which ones are not. You, on the other hand, like many leftists, hate using your brain, were too stupid to follow along with the investigation as it was happening, and now you're alleging that even the words from james comey's mouth that anyone else who committed the same crimes as hillary WOULD face criminal charges, is some kind of hearsay. You really need to seek professional help. Your stupidity is not funny",
