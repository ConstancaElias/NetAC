Welcome to Scotland.\u2019', 'It was a reference to the famous scene where Ewan McGregor\u2019s character, Mark Renton, rants about Scotland being \u2018colonised\u2019 by the English.', '\u2018Some hate the English. I don\u2019t,\u2019 he says. \u2018They\u2019re just wankers. We, on the other hand, are colonised by w**. Can\u2019t even find a decent culture to be colonised by.\u2019', 'He posted a photo on Instagram of American students watching the 1996 film based on Edinburgh author Irvine Welsh\u2019s book.', 'Police Scotland confirmed they had received a report about \u2018xenophobic comments\u2019 being made online last month.', 'The force said their officers had carried out a full investigation and concluded no crime had been committed.', 'Mr Mooney has worked at the university for 16 years and also regularly guest lectures at Sweden\u2019s J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University and Arcadia University in the US.', 'In December 2017, he was also appointed access and outreach development director at the university\u2019s Centre for Open Learning.', 'A Police Scotland spokesman said: \u2018On Monday 11th February, police in Edinburgh received a report of xenophobic comments made online.', '\u2018A full investigation was conducted and it was established that no crime had been committed. However, the matter was recorded as a hate incident.', '\u2018No further police action was required.\u2019', 'Edinburgh University declined to comment. The post is understood to have been reviewed by senior staff and deemed not to breach the university\u2019s social media policy.",
