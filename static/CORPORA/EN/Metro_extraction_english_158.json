        "postText": "A couple has been slammed for taking \u2018racist\u2019 wedding photos while pretending to be held at gunpoint in the \u2018Congo ghetto\u2019.', 'American photographer John Milton and his wife had their wedding in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, last year, and decided to do a photo shoot on top of a \u2018fiery volcano\u2019.', 'After spotting the images on Instagram, Cecilia Christin shared them to her Facebook page and said the newlyweds had used \u2018black and brown people and their experiences as props to gain a following on social media\u2019.', 'The 28-year-old ESL teacher wrote on Facebook: \u2018What in the fresh yt hell is this mayo encrusted bullshit? Literally too many things wrong here\u2019.', 'Christin told Insider: \u2018I decided to share these pictures in order to foster discussion within my friends and following, specifically about the accessorization of black bodies for this couple\u2019s photo shoot.\u2019', 'Jude Wanda, who is Congolese and has travelled to the same location, wrote on Twitter: \u2018This might be the single worst thing white people have done since the last terrible thing they did which was probably only an hour ago.\u2019', 'Wanda, who tweets under the handle JudeInLondon2, told BuzzFeed: \u2018I\u2019ve seen some shocking distasteful things on Instagram before but that left me speechless.\u2019', 'After Mr Milton posted the images on Instagram, one person asked why they were pretending to be held at gunpoint.', 'The photographer, who has since deactivated his Instagram, replied: \u2018We just wanted to make sure we didn\u2019t have typical goofy wedding shots.\u2019', 'The images were also posted to Steve Huff Photo, where Mr Milton said: \u2018These are from my recent wedding in Congo with security team, local tribe, chef, and a local pastor\u2026', '\u2018After the Congo wedding we needed an epic honeymoon therefore we decided upon a daring adventure in an Islamic region of Africa where sadly enough modern-day slavery still exists.', '\u2018We travelled to Mauritania to stow away on top of an iron ore train for a trip thru the Sahara Desert which happens to be the longest train in the world (2 miles long) and supposedly one of the most dangerous as it rolls thru land scattered with land mines and recently infiltrated by Al Qaeda\u2026\u2019', 'One image of the bride on top of the volcano was captioned: \u2018Saying our vows at the top of an active Congolese volcano with a local tribe while a civil war is brewing below is surrealism at its best.\u2019', 'Another one of the couple was captioned: \u2018Our epic wedding at the top of an epic fiery volcano in Congo.\u2019', 'Metro.co.uk has been unable to contact Mr Milton.",
