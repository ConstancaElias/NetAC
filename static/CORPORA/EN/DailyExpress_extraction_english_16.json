Very bizarre in the 21st Century. Is Buck House not aware of #MeToo?\u201d', 'Another said: \u201cShocked at the @RoyalFamily Could they not afford Zara Tindall the dignity of her own name? She\u2019s just grown and birthed a baby.', 'The woman deserves her own identity.MRS MICHAEL TINDALL ? !Wow.', A Twitter user posted: What's with these archaic birth announcements from @KensingtonRoyal 'Mrs Michael Tindall was safely delivered of a baby girl', 'Are you kidding me ? Mrs Michael Tindall ?? The baby was delivered via Ms Zara Phillips / Tindall's #vagina and her name doesn't even get mentioned ?? ?? ', 'Another added: Congratulations to them! \u2018Mrs Michael Tindall\u2019 sounds archaic as a description for a spirited high-achieving individual like Zara though!', 'The use of the husband\u2019s name to refer to his wife is formal tradition, which dates back centuries.', 'Zara, 37, welcomed a a baby girl, weighing 9lbs 3oz, into the world on Monday with her husband Mike Tindall by her side.', 'She gave birth to the royal baby at Stroud Maternity Unit in Gloucestershire.', 'Zara, the Queen's granddaughter, and rugby star Mike are already parents to adorable four-year-old Mia., 'The new baby is 19 th in line to the throne and the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's seventh great-grandchild, who are delighted at the news.', 'She is the heaviest royal baby in more than 100 years.', 'The previous record holder was Prince Louis who weighed 8lbs and 6oz when he was born on April 23 this year.', 'Buckingham Palace has declined to comment following the reaction.'",
