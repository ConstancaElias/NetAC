It's okay that your gonna spend the rest of your life alone, that your a sad lonely man who's just triggered by women empowerment. Calling me a <b> thot </b>isnt going to change the fact that you are scared of me, scared of women because maybe you got your poor feelings hurt by your ex wife. Any person who has been married that long and then divorced wouldn't spend 25 years with that person unless you really loved her (loved that<b>  woman</b>). So making generalizations that all women are bad or \"hookers\" means that you cannot control your emotions after spending like half your life with the person so you take it out on the internet. That is the truth here. Most triggered men in this comment section just went through something traumatic with <b> a woma</b>n and feels the need to put other women down. If you ever had a daughter with your ex wife, would you still have the audacity to call her<b>  a hook</b>er? You need to grow up, your not a man but a sad lonely little boy. No man would ever treat women like that, your basically calling your mothe<b> r a hoo</b>ker. Also adding on the fact that you said regular women are hookers because they take take take, which also adds to my point that your previous marriage didnt go so well because of that.",

This isn't whether one is good or bad but equality and being free from centuries of tradition with trap not only women but also men.\n1. when men can't report his <b> mental </b>illness like depression and anxiety in fear of societal exclusion\n ..<b> .sexism</b>\n\n2. When men are reluctant to join in a work place because it's traditionally seen as <b> a woma</b>n's job...eg. childcare, nursing \n.<b> ...sexi</b>sm\n\n3. When men are told that they will be sexually uncontrollable when they se<b> e a wo</b>man and will therefore rape.<b> \n....se</b>xism. Most men I know are not primitive and they are really civilized.\n\n4. When men have to bare a large portion the burden of financial responsibility because women are paid less or are even being fired due to pregnancy; this can cause a lot of stress.<b> \n.....s</b>exism\n\n5. When society says that men must have these set masculine qualities; facial hair, large penis, muscular body in order to reaffirm their masculinity. What if you don't have thes<b> e?\n....</b>sexism\n\nFeel free to add. It seems that traditions of the past are setting behind both men and women",

While women slowly stop being sexist towards women and praise \"girl power\" even more together, men still praise \"masculinity\" and laugh at men who aren't \"masculine\" enough... How many girls have you seen laughing at a girlfriend for wearing a beanie or boys clothes? And how many boys laugh at a boy if he does 1 single feminine thing? How many people shame Lilly Singh for being boyish and how many lash out at James Charles for being feminine?\n<b> \nSexism</b> today mostly goes in both directions. Why can't a man be girly? Because being \"like a girl\" is seen as \"shameful\", while women aren't shamed for being boyish. So it attacks women on one hand because being girly is seen as something weak and negative, but on the other hand it attacks also men, because they are the ones who aren't free to do what they want.",
