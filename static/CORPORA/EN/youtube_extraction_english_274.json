Doesnt anyone wonder how Jews were ordered by \"God\" to kill everyone in Joshua and other books of the <b> Old </b>Testament? How can people claim to kill women and children in the name of their \"God\" back then but now when it happens to them their being persecuted? How come its Gods judgment when Jews killed nations of people but now its antisemitism when the roles are flipped? Anyone care to share an answer?",

Electricity is an idea. The airplane is an idea. Washing with soap is an idea. That's why other countries have been able to adopt those innovations. No other country on earth has been able to approximate America \u2014 except our fellow Anglo-Saxon nations...\"(Ann Coulter, Adios America, 2015, page 51)\n \n\"America is not a mere landmass \u2014 otherwise, the Indians would have written the Declaration of Independence and put a man on the moon. Far from discovering America, Indians didn't even detect America. There was no America until the British and Dutch arrived. They were not 'immigrants' because there was no established society for them to move to. Without the white settlers, what is known as 'America' would still be an unnamed continent full of migratory tribes..\"(Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.51) \n\n\"Every single president, except Kennedy, was a Protestant. (Recent Democratic presidents were, of course, atheists, but all except JFK professed to be Protestants.\" (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.53)\n\n\"For one hundred years before the signing of the Declaration, and one hundred years after, America was extraordinarily un-diverse in<b>  ethnicity</b> (British, Dutch, Wes<b> t Africa</b>n, and Germanic), in religious practice (overwhelmingly Protestant, 98 percent Christian), in language (English), and in cultural mores.......And the country remained overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant right up until Teddy Kennedy decided to change it.\" (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, pp.53,54)\n\n\n\n\"Contrary to PC nonsense about America being a 'diverse' melting pot, America has never been <b> a 'nati</b>on of immigrants.'

The e<b> ntire </b>black population came from an area of West Africa about the size of Florida.\" \n\n\n\"Until Teddy Kennedy struck, America was never less than 99 percent white Western European an<b> d West A</b<b> >frica</b>n black.(10)  That's 'bi-racial,' not 'diverse.'\" (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.54)\n\n\n\"Two centuries after the first Europeans settled America, the white population was  80 percent British and 98 percent Protestant.(12)  A century after that, the populace was  still overwhelmingly English-speaking, British, and Protestant, but, for an exciting  change, also included Germans and Scandinavians.(13) The colorful immigrants at the turn of the nineteenth century were wildly different from the original settlers in the sense that they were white people from a different part of Western Europe.\" (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.55)\n\n\n\"The entire time it was processing immigrants from 1892 until 1954, Ellis Island  received only 12 million immigrants.(15)\"  (Ann Coulter, Adios America, 2015, Page 56)\n\n \n \nCan Anyone Prove  the Above Statements  Wrong from a  book called:  \"Adios  America\" ?\n\n<b> \n43 'T</b>he alien who is among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower. 44 He shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.\n45 'Moreover all these curses shall come upon you and pursue and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you [a]did not obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded you.'\n(Deuteronomy 28:43-45 New King James Version-NKJV)\n\n=-======================================================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\nDeuteronomy 28 New King James Version (NKJV)\nBlessings on Obedience\nDeut. 28:1 'Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today, that the LORD your God will set you high above all nations of the earth. 2 And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the LORD your God:\n3 'Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the country.\n4 'Blessed sha<b> ll be </b>the fruit of your body, the produce of your ground and the increase of your herds, the increase of your cattle and the offspring of your flocks.\n5 'Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.\n6 'Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.\n7 'The LORD will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before your face; they shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways.\n8 'The LORD will command the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you set your hand, and He will bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you.\n9 'The LORD will establish you as a holy people to Himself, just as He has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in His ways. 10 Then all peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they shall be afraid of you. 11 And the LORD will grant you plenty of goo<b> ds, in</b> the fruit of your body, in the increase of your livestock, and in the produce of your ground, in the land of which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you. 12 The LORD will open to you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand.

P.O.C. stop taking their bait, and us whites need to stop taking their bait when they want to jump in back over and play off their whiteness. It is time to deal with the biggest oppressors on the planet. We do not control the media, Hollywood, music industry, the public school system, medical system,  and the political and financial systems of the world. Gentile fronts will no longer work. The Jews are boxed in a corner now that they have no way getting out of. Their only salvation is to make peace with the world. Now  I do not want to see Jews getting picked on, or hurt. It is time though they stop destroying mankind.",

Because without a doubt the world will forget about Palestinians, and brotherly Arabs will attack them from all sides and will make a bloody mess of them the moment the State of Israel cease to exist.

Saying that globalism isn't controlled by the Zionists is just ignorance. If anyone were to read books anymore they would know the oppression of Jews was quite over-exaggerated, and were denied immigration to the united states JUST like the Irish and Italians. They were kicked out of 400 countries (most multiple times, as countries tend to change names) for trying to take over aka..federal reserve..feminism..migration of 3rd world peoples to Europe. Just think it's kind of ironic they push this idea of \"inclusion\" and \"diversity\" while requiring genetic testing on people who want to move to Israel to see if they are Jewish enough. If diversity is so great why aren't THEY taking in these Muslim migrants?",

The difference between you and me is that I am telling the truth and you are fake news! You Christians think you are perfect and never do any thing wrong. Mean while last time I looked it was Christians doing the most crimes in the United States. It is Christians who are cheating us when we need our air conditioning fixed. It is Christians who put in cheap materials and try to cheat people.  It is Christians who are calling us up every day as telemarketers. It is Christians who show hate when some one is not there religion. I could go on and on about your beloved religion. Leave the Jewish people alone. They want to live in peace.

Already bad enough with what occurred in Europe during WW2, now that they have been allocated into their homeland by the British. Muslims in general and Muslim powers wielded to NOT coexist and hence rejected these poor bastards who have been mistreated for centuries... Now the Muslim world is toxic and shit-stained because it no longer known for what it used to be, and that is being full of scholars and secularism as that of the Christian World. Dominating extremisms in any religious body and preaching the ideas and sentiments of hate/and or discrimination against others is bad, that is the current state of affairs for how Muslims are acting and viewed by not only the JEWS but other worldly populations. Now take into account the fact that your mama and papa will be having children and spreading such ideas, and your community and friends to the point where it becomes natural. Politics and Religion aren't the same thing but can always be mixed to cause such things. Look at Israel and look at Iran.",

                    "commentText": "Yes, it inherently is. BDS is an organization that wants to isolate and demonize the only Jewish state in the world on all fronts, and which also applies the modern variant of the \"kauft nicht bei juden\" strategy. BDS is not concerned about \"human rights violations\" because if they were, Israel would not be their priority. BDS unilaterally focuses on the only democracy in the Middle East while giving carte blanche to genocidal dictatorships such as Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. With this, BDS puts aside the most important principle of human rights violations, namely, deal with the worst first. Israel does not come up with this by any measurement. Indeed, according to the world freedom house, Israel has a democratic system that, based on integrity and functioning, is comparable to that of Belgium and America. Fortunately, there is a term to explain this attitude of BDS, namely anti-Semitism. History shows that new anti-Semites always claim that they are not anti-Semites, but that their hate differs from the <b> old.</b> First, the Jews were attacked on their religion, then culture, then<b>  ethnicity</b> and now their state. Anti-Semitism persists, the facade only changes.",

                    "commentText": "@mrmiura story Anti-Semitism operates by discrediting Jews and accusing them of barbaric activities. In the past, this was, among other things, the blood libel, the myth that Jews would bake their sandwiches with the blood of Christian children, and now it is the claim that Israel is allegedly violating human rights. This is because the United Nations has been hijacked by brutal dictatorships that have made it their life's work to demonize and delegitimize Israel its right to exist. The fact that countries such as Iraq, Congo, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia are members of the UN Human Rights Council already harms the integrity of these resolutions. Nonetheless, the purpose of these accusations is to be able to characterize Jews as monsters. The consequence of this is that the Jewish people lose their humanity, therefore, offering a justification to antisemites to either eradicate them or, more notable in the present, to argue the annihilate of their only state. Thus, making anti-zionism inherently antisemitic.\n\n\nHistory shows that new anti-Semites always claim that they are not anti-Semites, but that what they do differs fundamentally from the ideas of their predecessors. First, the Jews were attacked because of their religion, then their culture, then their <b> ethnicity </b>and now their state. Anti-Semitism persists, the facade only changes.",

It's going to get worse before it gets better at the return of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The Lord is using His enemies to give His people (Jacob) trouble for our sins in order to cleanse us, correct our behavior and save us from His wrath and from\nhell. 'In all history there has never been such a time of terror. It will be a time of trouble for my people Israel. (Hebrew Jacob; also in 30:10b). Yet in the end, they will be saved!' (Jeremiah 30:7 NLT) \n\n'Two-thirds of the people in the land will be cut off and die, says the Lord. But a third will be left in the land. I will bring that group through the fire and make them pure, just as gold and silver are refined and purified by fire. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, \u2018These are my people,' and they will say, \u2018The Lord is our God.' ' (Zechariah 13:8-9 NLT; see purified in 1Peter 1:6-7) '\u2026the people will return to the Lord their God and to David's descendant, their king. (Hebrew: to David their king). They will come trembling in awe to the Lord, and they will receive his good gifts in the last days.' (Hosea 3:5 NLT; see gifts in Acts 2:38)\n\n'In that day the remnant of Israel, the survivors of the house of Jacob, will no longer rely on him who struck them down but will truly rely on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God. Though your people, O Israel, be like the sand by the sea, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overwhelming and righteous. The Lord, the Lord Almighty, will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land. Therefore, this is what the Lord, the Lord Almighty says; 'O my people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians, who beat you with a rod and lift up a club against you, as Egypt did. Very soon my anger against you will end and my wrath will be directed to their destruction.' (Isaiah 10:20-25 NIV; see Isaiah 10:1-25 NLT) \n\nSo repent of your sins and turn your heart fully to God and you will be drawn to His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved. 'Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.' (John 3:36 NIV)",

            "commentText": "I think the Left has Identity Politics completely wrong.  I am not just referring to this video about Jews, but to the entire AJ+ series about various identities or groups of people. \n\n\nIdentities are groups and therefore are constructs of what I call Groupism, the ideology that people should be classified into different groups for the purpose of differential treatments, which is basically the definition of CONSERVATISM.  This is in contrast to Individualism which is basically LIBERALISM.  Think about it, <b> racism </b>is the classification of people into racial identities,<b>  sexism</b> is the classification of people int<b> o gende</b>r identities, and Conservatives are the ones who like to do these things.  \n\n\nIdentity Politics are NOT about supporting or affirming identities, the EXACT OPPOSITE, they are about REJECTING identities.  For example, Feminism is NOT abo<b> ut gend</b>er groupings, or about affirming women, or about the distinction of the sexes. Feminism is ab<b> out gen</b>der equality, it is a subset of INDIVIDUALISM, the ideology that people should be judged by their own individual merits and not by their membership to various groups.    \n\n\nI think that the Left is being led by poor leadership, by people who just don't understand.  Instead of making documentaries about various identities that I would argue promote fundamentalism instead of tolerance, the only identity that is of unifying importance is the identity of INDIVIDUALITY.   It is not necessary for outsiders to understand the culture and history of Jews, it is only necessary that they understand that Jews are foremost INDIVIDUALS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.  We need to break fundamentalism, not promote it.",

I would also say that while there are Jews who do think we can cling to white society and not be in solidarity with other marginalized peoples in the US, there are plenty of  non-Jewish people (including Linda Sarsour, who you feature in this video) who also need to accept that Jews are a marginalized people under threat in this country--I notice that Sarsour in the clip you provided referred to us as being purely a religion when we are an ethnocultural community as well, and Sarsour has a history of only being in solidarity with us when we're dead and viewing us with some suspicion when we're alive. Not to pick on Sarsour, as there are plenty of left-wing activists in the US who need to be in solidarity with us. Also the idea that Jews need to learn to be in solidarity with others is an insult to the Jewish social justice activists who have been working for justice in this country for both Jews and others for over a century. Other than that, a good video.",

He should register as a foreign agent already just like anyone who lobby for a foreign country through either donations or any form.  \n\nWhite Nationalists such as Richard Spencer view Israel as a role model for their dream of a White-European ethnostate and even themselves identify as 'Zionists'. People who are bigoted towards Jews have a habit of supporting the Zionist movement as even Hitler supported it in the early 1930s because they view Zionism as an assured way to get rid of their Jewish population\nWhen It comes to the idea that all Jews in the world share the same <b> ethnicity </b>that is a belief no different than Muslims telling me that people in haven will speak Arabic.

Anyone who betrays Israel betrays I, YAHUVEH and betrays MY Son YAHUSHUA. Anyone who is an enemy of Israel has set themselves up to be an enemy of I, YAHUVEH the Creator of Israel, also the Creator of America and I YAHUVEH the Creator of the universe.  Any leader that puffs themselves up and makes themselves as a god and says, \"I will destroy Israel\" shakes his fist in the face of I, YAHUVEH the Creator. America you shall surely pay. America you have already begun to burn, you burn with MY rage, you burn with MY anger. You cry out for mercy on America yet you even want to strike out the NAME of GOD away from the children's memory. \n\nI am angry MY Children, for you cry out for mercy on America but the leader of America puffs himself up like a god, he is not a god. I hear the cries of MY People in Israel, yes even those who do not acknowledge MY Son YAHUSHUA but they cry out to ME MY Children, they honour MY Sabbath Days, they keep MY Jewish Feasts and obey MY Torah. Israel carries the blood of YAHUSHUA and Jerusalem carries the blood of YAHUSHUA, though they receive it not. Beware America you are a Trojan Horse. I, YAHUVEH remind you of what happens to a Trojan Horse. I, YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA now prophesy through MY Handmaiden, I, YAHUVEH will strike down that Trojan Horse and when I strike it down it shall never rise again. I, YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA will cut off the horses head. I, YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA will cut off the horse's hooves. You America will not be able to move anymore and the merchants shall cry from afar off, as they will see America burn from afar off. (Rev. 18) \n\nYou send fear among the world and say, \"Stay out of Israel, it is too dangerous to visit\" and yet the Palestine enemies who despise MY NAME, to the world you lift them up as heroes and this you loudly proclaim. Oh America, you make this promise to Palestine's, you falsely say, \"I, America will give back Israel especially Jerusalem to the enemies of I, YAHUVEH.\" Palestine's have set themselves up as YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA's enemies. Palestine's have killed MY Hebrew Children. Palestine's are trying to steal the <b> apple </b>of MY eye. So America, for helping them you have incurred MY wrath and America even your name, I YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA now despise. I have had mercy thus far, for the cries of MY True Children who cry out. But MY True Children must know this, the longer I have held back MY wrath the angrier I YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA became and America you will pay for this. \n\nSo this is a message to MY Beloved Children, anoint your houses once again, cry out for mercy on your own house and I, YAHUVEH will hear you, MY Children, once again. Repent MY Children for your own house for you cannot repent for the sins of America. For the stench of the sins reach Heaven and all of Heaven holds their nose for no<b>  nation</b> has done what America has done and yet n<b> o natio</b>n was blessed like America was blessed. You want to strike out 'O<b> ne Nati</b>on Under GOD' then you will have '<b> One Nat</b>ion Under MY Feet.' I YAHUVEH will stomp you, for you just struck out your mercy; you just struck out MY favour. You want to strike out 'In GOD we Trust' from your currency then all you have is 'In (America) we Trust.' \n\nI'll show you what happens <b> to a na</b>tion that is not under GOD YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA's protection, it will not be a pretty sight. You will find out America, just how puny you are in your strength and might. You want to strike out 'In GOD We Trust' then America all you have left is 'In We Trust.' For right there you have stated that I YAHUVEH the GOD that set you apart has just struck out MY mercy, you have just struck out MY protection for you rely only on yourself and so America let the world see what happens when it is only in you that you trust. \n\n________________________________________________________________\nProphecy 58: Butchers I call you, murderous butchers! Your fate shall be that of a butcherous murdere<b> r you do</b>ctors and scientists.  What you call the Supreme Court in America, the heathen politicians have brought forth this judgment on America. You have no one to blame but yourselves. You are reaping what you sowed. Why do you think that I do not hear the silent screams of the unborn just because you have deafened your ears and blinded your eyes to this murder? Do you not know I created the souls of the unborn as well as the born? Heathens, Pharisee's, how dare you rewrite what I call murder? Who are your politicians to declare what I call sinful lifestyles. \n\nDo you think I am impressed, with your new laws? I have shown you judgment on America and I tell you just wait until you see the signs in the sky, and the effects on the earth as the volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, all join together as if in a chorus, singing the song of the doomed. If you think this is horror you have not even yet seen MY wrath begin to fall. And I speak not just to America for she is just a young baby thumbing her nose at ME. \n\nI warned MY Handmaiden to tell the people to watch around the day of Rosh Ha Shanah and especially this month and the month of October. Remember what I YAHUVEH warned, 'America I saved the worst for last.' You must wake up and realize you are a country set apart to glorify YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA and how much praise and honour has America brought 'I AM'? Woe be unto this country if it does not get back to Holiness, 'I AM' the Lord GOD YAHUVEH this is the saddest day for America, without a shot being fired to defend herself, without any notice then that which I speak from MY Apostles and Prophets and how many listened? America suffers great casualties and deaths. I had to allow satan to sift you for you have wandered far from MY paths of Holiness. You say this <b> is one </b>nation under GOD then obey ME. Obey the Holy Scriptures. Deny and reject all that is unholy, get back to the country I loved and set apart. \n\nBut despite what I told Jonah, I gave her a chance as I spared Ninevah and I shall spare you America, if you will but once again follow MY Laws and stop passing laws that try and change MY Laws that was written with MY own finger in a tablet of stone. I have sent these out with the warnings of Jonah and how few listen until I allowed the horror that befell America today. MY Children tell ME this, as you sit transfixed to your televisions and radio's and watch in horror and shock. Wondering why this is happening? What is the difference between America suffering the impact of terrorism and Israel suffering from terrorism or Kosovo or Africa, and many other places around the world? \n\nYou casually read it in your newspapers, hear it on your radio's and televisions, or watch the headlines appear on your computers, and yet no country feels the pain until I allow you to feel it hit your own countries until the death toll <b> is yo</b>ur race, kindred, tongue and your nations. Hypocrites! You weep and wail now only because it is <b> your ow</b>n nation. Now, will you take seriously when others suffer from wars? America, repent and get back to the country I set apart for MY Praise, Honor and Glory, be an example once again of Godliness. Have you so quickly forgotten the depression and the miracles I did? That is why your economy was blessed. I don't want to take you back there again to learn that lesson. Judgment was delayed far too long.

                    "commentText": "AMERICA REPENT or RETURN to Messianic Jewishness of YAHUSHUA\n( Come out of orthodox Jews & paganic christianity )\n\nProphecy 59: You must urgently get these messages out. Be not so concerned in the order right now. Instead be concerned with the urgency. For indeed I gave Elisabeth that vision when one who speaks for others with itching ears and makes promises I have not said. I showed her that vision of the American flag and as MY NAME is struck out and as MY NAME is off the currency, although it is only generic for although I am GOD,you know MY NAME and as it is struck out of the currency, so too will the protection of America. And as I showed her the flag, it will burn from the bottom right corner, to the top left corner. Until this flag is consumed with MY anger and MY rage. \n\nHow dare New York, after I poured forth MY mercy and MY love. I spared untold uncounted souls from Sept. 11, 2001 from many days hence as they unburied those that they thought were dead. As I had MY angels chase them out before the buildings collapsed and now they dare to defy what is Holy, they dare to profane the name 'marriage,' that which I have given as a symbol for the Bride and the Bridegroom. It is not man- man. It is not Adam and Steve, it is Adam and Eve. MY anger and MY rage will burn New York if they continue on. I have warned them and I have warned them that Sept. 11 was only a sample. How dare them and every state including Canada and the Providences that follow who dare to do the same. I remind you what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah. Their fate shall be the same. \n\nDare not say that the hedge of protection is around America for this is a lie straight from satan's prophets' mouths. The hedge of protection is around MY People, those that call out in MY NAME. Those that worship YAHUSHUA and those that honour MY True Sabbaths, those that repent and humble themselves, those that look up and know that redemption draweth nigh. MY Babies, Bride, Chosen Ones and Elect, these are the ones the hedge of protection are around. I have torn down the hedge of protection around America and you shall see that flag burn. Be not angry at MY Apostles and Prophets that I send to warn the doom will come. Instead, thank ME that I care so much to warn. \n\nI warned this Handmaiden, again and again, I gave her a word an audible word, I told her to tell the people, \"I will do all I promise to do.\" That not only means the wrath to come that means protecting you. I warned her in 1999, people notice the date, if it had not been for the intercessory prayer warriors that arose and fasted Sept 11, 1999. It would have been the same fate as in 2001, Sept. 11. Because I hold back MY wrath because of the prayers of the righteous that availeth much then the Apostles and Prophets are called false. \n\nWhat would you say if I didn't hold it back anymore? Then will you believe MY Apostles and Prophets? Is this what you really want? I have held it back for the sake of those that shudder in fear and tears. MY Little Ones, MY Babies that I cradle in MY arms. I hold it back thus far, not for the sake of a glorified America who has made themselves a god in their own eyes. But I have held back MY wrath, for MY Little Ones who, like a little child, looks up with trust and love to their Father with their eyes. But America, you shall burn. I know this Prophet that speaks forth, her voice is not going to want to be heard. It goes against The Prophecy Club's messages, those that speak of abundance and prosperity, and those that speak of protection though it's undeserved.\u00a0 \n\nSo this is MY message this day, as you see the name 'GOD' struck out of the Pledge of Allegiance. As you see the word 'GOD' struck off your currency. The vision I have given MY Daughter this day, you will see the American flag burn and the merchants shall cry from afar off and the world shall weep and lament but will they learn a lesson from her?Oh, how few listen their ears are full of wax, their eyes are <b> blind,</b> they only want to see from their own eyes and they don't want to see through MINE. \n\nAmerica, you will reap what you are sowing. Again I repeat, the hedge of protection is not around America. The hedge of protection is around MY Beloved, MY Babies, Bride, Chosen Ones and Elect. Look up MY Children, deny not your faith, deny not the NAME of YAHUSHUA ha MASHIACH. Deny not the NAME of YAHUVEH. Deny not the anointing of MY RUACH ha KODESH. Deny not MY Commandments and MY Laws and MY Statutes, and the Word that was made flesh. Look up MY Children for truly your redemption draweth nigh.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",

Your fate shall be\nthat of a butcherous murderer you <b> doctors </b>and scientists. What you call the Supreme Court in America, the heathen politicians have brought forth this judgment on America. You have no one to blame but yourselves. You are reaping what you sowed. Why do you think that I do not hear the silent screams of the unborn just because you have deafened your ears and blinded your eyes to this murder? Do you not know I created the souls of the unborn as well as the born? Heathens, Pharisee's, how dare you rewrite what I call murder? Who are your politicians to declare what I call sinful lifestyles. \n\nDo you think I am impressed, with your new laws? I have shown you judgment on America and I tell you just wait until you see the signs in the sky, and the effects on the earth as the volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, all join together as if in a chorus, singing the song of the doomed. If you think this is horror you have not even yet seen MY wrath begin to fall. And I speak not just to America for she is just a young baby thumbing her nose at ME. \n\nI warned MY Handmaiden to tell the people to watch around the day of Rosh Ha Shanah and especially this month and the month of October. Remember what I YAHUVEH warned, 'America I saved the worst for last.' You must wake up and realize you are a country set apart to glorify YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA and how much praise and honour has America brought 'I AM'? Woe be unto this country if it does not get back to Holiness, 'I AM' the Lord GOD YAHUVEH this is the saddest day for America, without a shot being fired to defend herself, without any notice then that which I speak from MY Apostles and Prophets and how many listened? America suffers great casualties and deaths. I had to allow satan to sift you for you have wandered far from MY paths of Holiness. You say this is one<b>  nation</b> under GOD then obey ME. Obey the Holy Scriptures. Deny and reject all that is unholy, get back to the country I loved and set apart. \n\nBut despite what I told Jonah, I gave her a chance as I spared Ninevah and I shall spare you America, if you will but once again follow MY Laws and stop passing laws that try and change MY Laws that was written with MY own finger in a tablet of stone. I have sent these out with the warnings of Jonah and how few listen until I allowed the horror that befell America today. MY Children tell ME this, as you sit transfixed to your televisions and radio's and watch in horror and shock. Wondering why this is happening? What is the difference between America suffering the impact of terrorism and Israel suffering from terrorism or Kosovo or Africa, and many other places around the world? \n\nYou casually read it in your newspapers, hear it on your radio's and televisions, or watch the headlines appear on your computers, and yet no country feels the pain until I allow you to feel it hit your own countries until the death toll is you<b> r rac</b>e, kindred, tongue and your nations. Hypocrites! You weep and wail now only because it is your o<b> wn nati</b>on. Now will you take seriously when others suffer from wars? America, repent and get back to the country I set apart for MY Praise, Honor and Glory, be an example once again of Godliness. Have you so quickly forgotten the depression and the miracles I did? That is why your economy was blessed. I don't want to take you back there again to learn that lesson. Judgment was delayed far too long. \n\n\nProphecy 59: You must urgently get these messages out. Be not so concerned in the order right now. Instead be concerned with the urgency.\nFor indeed I gave Elisabeth that vision when one who speaks for others with itching ears and makes promises I have not said. I showed her that vision of the American flag and as MY NAME is struck out and as MY NAME is off the currency, although it is only generic for although I am GOD, you know MY NAME and as it is struck out of the currency, so too will the protection of America. And as I showed her the flag, it will burn from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. Until this flag is consumed with MY anger and MY rage. \n\nHow dare New York, after I poured forth MY mercy and MY love. I spared untold uncounted souls from Sept. 11, 2001, from many days hence as they unburied those that they thought were dead. As I had MY angels chase them out before the buildings collapsed and now they dare to defy what is Holy, they dare to profane the name 'marriage,' that which I have given as a symbol for the Bride and the Bridegroom. It is not man- man. It is not Adam and Steve, it is Adam and Eve. MY anger and MY rage will burn New York if they continue on. I have warned them and I have warned them that Sept. 11 was only a sample. How dare them and every state including Canada and the Providences that follow who dare to do the same. I remind you what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah. Their fate shall be the same. \n\nDare not say that the hedge of protection is around America for this is a lie straight from satan's prophets' mouths. The hedge of protection is around MY People, those that call out in MY NAME. Those that worship YAHUSHUA and those that honour MY True Sabbaths, those that repent and humble themselves, those that look up and know that redemption draweth nigh. MY Babies, Bride, Chosen Ones and Elect, these are the ones the hedge of protection are around. I have torn down the hedge of protection around America and you shall see that flag burn. Be not angry at MY Apostles and Prophets that I send to warn the doom will come. Instead, thank ME that I care so much to warn. \n\nI warned this Handmaiden, again and again, I gave her a word an audible word, I told her to tell the people, \"I will do all I promise to do.\" That not only means the wrath to come that means protecting you. I warned her in 1999, people notice the date, if it had not been for the intercessory prayer warriors that arose and fasted Sept 11, 1999. It would have been the same fate as in 2001, Sept. 11. Because I hold back MY wrath because of the prayers of the righteous that availeth much then the Apostles and Prophets are called false. \n\nWhat would you say if I didn't hold it back anymore? Then will you believe MY Apostles and Prophets? Is this what you really want? I have held it back for the sake of those that shudder in fear and tears. MY Little Ones, MY Babies that I cradle in MY arms. I hold it back thus far, not for the sake of a glorified America who has made themselves a god in their own eyes. But I have held back MY wrath, for MY Little Ones who, like a little child, looks up with trust and love to their Father with their eyes. But America, you shall burn. I know this Prophet that speaks forth, her voice is not going to want to be heard. It goes against The Prophecy Club's messages, those that speak of abundance and prosperity, and those that speak of protection though it's undeserved.\u00a0 \n\nSo this is MY message this day, as you see the name 'GOD' struck out of the Pledge of Allegiance. As you see the word 'GOD' struck off your currency. The vision I have given MY Daughter this day, you will see the American flag burn and the merchants shall cry from afar off and the world shall weep and lament but will they learn a lesson from her? Oh, how few listen their ears are full of wax, their eyes <b> are bl</b>ind, they only want to see from their own eyes and they don't want to see through MINE. \n\nAmerica, you will reap what you are sowing. Again I repeat, the hedge of protection is not around America. The hedge of protection is around MY Beloved, MY Babies, Bride, Chosen Ones and Elect. Look up MY Children, deny not your faith, deny not the NAME of YAHUSHUA ha MASHIACH. Deny not the NAME of YAHUVEH. Deny not the anointing of MY RUACH ha KODESH. Deny not MY Commandments and MY Laws and MY Statutes, and the Word that was made flesh. Look up MY Children for truly your redemption draweth nigh. \u00a0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",

The more they exert control on the rest of the population the more they become resented which causes them to react in fear and tighten or increase their influence and control to the point where life becomes unbearable which causes those around them to react harshly.... Usually just forcing Jews to go away. Hitler told Jews to leave for years before the first poor Jew was put on a train.\nEverywhere in Europe and America Jews have been welcomed and allowed to gain control, only to face push back. We have been too good and too patient. The only places where Jews have not faced huge push back (until recently) is in Muslim countries because their power and wealth and influence is limited. They're second class citizens and they somehow don't wear out their welcome.",

In the past, this was, among other things, the blood libel, the myth that Jews would bake their sandwiches with the blood of Christian children, and now it is the claim that Israel is allegedly violating human rights. This is because the United Nations has been hijacked by brutal dictatorships that have made it their life's work to demonize and delegitimize Israel its right to exist. The fact that countries such as Iraq, Congo, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia are members of the UN Human Rights Council already harms the integrity of these resolutions. Nonetheless, the purpose of these accusations is to be able to characterize Jews as monsters. The consequence of this is that the Jewish people lose their humanity, therefore, offering a justification to antisemites to either eradicate them or, more notable in the present, to argue the annihilate of their only state. Thus, making anti-zionism inherently antisemitic.",
